SCOPUS_ID:85035128299;This study develops a stochastic approach to the short-term forecasting of hotel booking arrivals. We investigate the key characteristics of booking arrivals, specifically the time-varying arrivals rates, high variability in the final demand, and the strong positive correlations between arrivals in different time periods. We examine three Poisson mixture models to capture these salient features of booking arrivals. In particular, the presence of strong inter-temporal correlations can be leveraged for forecasting future arrivals based on the early realizations. We suggest a new forecasting method that exploits the intrinsic correlations between early and late bookings and then present validation results of data from a major hotel chain along with a comparison to benchmark models. Our empirical study confirms that our dynamic updating method leveraging inter-temporal correlations can significantly improve the short-term forecasting accuracy of hotel room demand.;Lee M.;2018-06-01;Modeling and forecasting hotel room demand based on advance booking information

SCOPUS_ID:85036467319;Cloud computing has drastically transformed the means of computing in recent years. In spite of numerous benefits, it suffers from some challenges too. Major challenges of cloud computing include dynamic resource scaling and power consumption. These factors lead a cloud system to become inefficient and costly. The workload prediction is one of the variables by which the efficiency and operational cost of a cloud can be improved. Accuracy is the key component in workload prediction and the existing approaches lag in producing 100% accurate results. The researchers are also putting their consistent efforts for its improvement. In this paper, we present a workload prediction model using neural network and self adaptive differential evolution algorithm. The model is capable of learning the best suitable mutation strategy along with optimal crossover rate. The experiments were performed on the benchmark data sets of NASA and Saskatchewan servers’ HTTP traces for different prediction intervals. We compared the results with prediction model based on well known back propagation learning algorithm and received significant improvement. The proposed model attained a shift up to 168 times in the error reduction and prediction error is reduced up to 0.001.;Kumar J.;2018-04-01;Workload prediction in cloud using artificial neural network and adaptive differential evolution
SCOPUS_ID:85038816447;Online reviews have been extensively studied in the hospitality and tourism literature. However, while user-provided photos embedded in online reviews accumulate in large quantities, their informational value has not been well understood likely due to technical challenges. The goal of this study is to introduce deep learning for computer vision to understand information value of online hotel reviews. Using a dataset collected from two social media sites, we compared deep learning models with other machine learning techniques to examine the effect of user-provided photos on review helpfulness. Findings show that deep learning models were more useful in predicting review helpfulness than other models. While user-provided photos alone did not have the same impact as review texts, combining review texts and user-provided photos produced the highest performance. Implications for the applications of deep learning technologies in hospitality and tourism research, as well as limitations and directions for future research, are discussed.;Ma Y.;2018-04-01;Effects of user-provided photos on hotel review helpfulness: An analytical approach with deep leaning
SCOPUS_ID:85034053217;In this paper a new hybrid method combining variational mode decomposition (VMD) and single or Multi-kernel regularized pseudo inverse neural network (MKRPINN) is presented for effective and efficient wind power forecasting. The original non-linear and non-stationary time series data is decomposed using VMD approach to prevent the mutual effects among the different modes. The proposed VMD-KRPINN (VMD based kernel regularized pseudo inverse neural network) and VMD-MKRPINN methods are then used to predict wind power generation of a wind farm in the state of Wyoming, USA for different time intervals of 10 min, 30 min, 1 h and 3 h ahead. Comparison with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based kernel regularized pseudo inverse neural networks is also presented in the paper to validate the superiority of the VMD based wind power prediction models. Also to improve the performance of the proposed EMD-MKPRINN and VMD-MKRPINN models, their parameters are optimized using vaporization and precipitation based water cycle algorithm (VAPWCA). Further a fast reduced version of the VMD-KRPINN is presented in the paper to reduce the execution time substantially using randomly selected support vectors from the data set while resulting in a reasonably accurate forecast.;Naik J.;2018-04-01;Short term wind power forecasting using hybrid variational mode decomposition and multi-kernel regularized pseudo inverse neural network
SCOPUS_ID:85036466647;This study firstly proposed the use of 3D MRI images to analyze loins in a non-destructive way. For that, interpolation and reconstruction techniques are applied on 2D MRI images of loins and the computational texture algorithms were adapted to analyze the obtained 3D images. The influence of the i) MRI acquisition sequences (Spin Echo (SE), Gradient Echo (GE), Turbo 3D (T3D)), ii) 3D texture features algorithms (GLCM, NGLDM, GLRLM, GLCM + NGLDM + GLRLM), and iii) regression techniques (Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Isotonic Regression (IR)) was also evaluated. Combinations of SE or GE with any texture algorithm and any regression technique gave accurate results, with correlation coefficients higher than 0.75 and mean absolute error lower than 2. However, considering not only the accuracy of the methodology but also the computational cost, the use of GE, GLCM and IR could be proposed to determine physico-chemical parameters of loins non-destructively.;Avila M.;2018-04-01;Applying 3D texture algorithms on MRI to evaluate quality traits of loin
SCOPUS_ID:85034648827;Optimal PV based EV charging is performed either by predicting or by measuring PV output. However, due to the uncertainties associated with the variables involved, both the charging methods are not only disposed to significant voltage limit violations but also may cause PV energy harvest reduction. Hence, a methodology is proposed in this paper, which utilizes the measured PV output of a given sample and the supplied historical ramp to predict the PV output of the immediate next sample using a non-iterative method. The charging rates of the EV population are, subsequently, adjusted in the interval between the successive samples based on the predicted PV output with the help of a proposed SOC based charging strategy. The proposed methodology has been tested at the University of Queensland (UQ)’s solar and parking facilities coupled with its electric grid. The results show that aside from reducing the probability of voltage limit violations (PVV), the proposed methodology can increase the PV energy harvest. Moreover, it is cost-effective as compared to the conventional method such as onsite battery energy storage deployment.;Islam M.S.;2018-04-01;PV based EV charging at universities using supplied historical PV output ramp
SCOPUS_ID:85032699626;The integration of storage systems into smart grids is being widely analysed in order to increase the flexibility of the power system and its ability to accommodate a higher share of wind and solar power. The success of this process requires a comprehensive techno-economic study of the storage technology in contrast with electricity market behaviour. The focus of this work is on lead-acid and vanadium redox flow batteries. This paper presents a novel probabilistic optimization model for managing energy storage systems. The model is able to incorporate the forecasting error of electricity prices, offering with this a near-optimal control option. Using real data from the Spanish electricity market from the year 2016, the probability distribution of forecasting error is determined. The model determines electricity price uncertainty by means of Monte Carlo Simulation and includes it in the energy arbitrage problem, which is eventually solved by using an integer-coded genetic algorithm. In this way, the probability distribution of the revenue is determined with consideration of the complex behaviours of lead-acid and vanadium redox flow batteries as well as their associated operating devices such as power converters.;Lujano-Rojas J.M.;2018-04-01;Novel probabilistic optimization model for lead-acid and vanadium redox flow batteries under real-time pricing programs
SCOPUS_ID:85038823053;The constant growth of the energy crisis within the ICT Sector has persistently gained importance thereby prompting endeavors to curb growing energy demands and associated expenditures. This paper attempts to propose an intelligent energy aware task allocation and resource provisioning technique running in GreenSched model. The GreenSched model tends to exploit the heterogeneity of tasks and multi-core capacity of the varied nodes in the cloud environment and attempts to proactively schedule the deadline-and budget- constrained tasks on identified less energy consuming or energy aware nodes. It implements a Forward-only Counter Propagation Network (CPN) based intelligent scheduler unit that runs a scheduling technique to identify the best nodes for the task allocation process, one with least energy consumption and deadline- and budget -fulfilling capability. The nodes are clustered and classified by comparing their energy consumption values. The proposed algorithm has been implemented using the CloudSim toolkit and Kohonen and CP-ANN Toolbox with the help of MatlabTM platform. The experimental results exhibit that the proposed technique offers reduced energy consumption along with an overall improvement in the performance by meeting the deadline-and-budget constraints imposed by the users.;Kaur T.;2018-03-01;GreenSched: An intelligent energy aware scheduling for deadline-and-budget constrained cloud tasks
SCOPUS_ID:85037706900;Chemicals in consumer products have become the focus of recent regulatory developments including California's Safer Consumer Products Act. However, quantifying the amount of chemicals released during the use and post-use phases of consumer products is challenging, limiting the ability to understand their impacts. Here we present a comprehensive framework, OrganoRelease, for estimating the release of organic chemicals from the use and post-use of consumer products given limited information. First, a novel Chemical Functional Use Classifier estimates functional uses based on chemical structure. Second, the quantity of chemicals entering different product streams is estimated based on market share data of the chemical functional uses. Third, chemical releases are estimated based on either chemical product categories or functional uses by using the Specific Environmental Release Categories and EU Technological Guidance Documents. OrganoRelease connects 19 unique functional uses and 14 product categories across 4 data sources and provides multiple pathways for chemical release estimation. Available user information can be incorporated in the framework at various stages. The Chemical Functional Use Classifier achieved an average accuracy above 84% for nine functional uses, which enables the OrganoRelease to provide release estimates for the chemical, mostly using only the molecular structure. The results can be can be used as input for methods estimating environmental fate and exposure.;Tao M.;2018-03-01;OrganoRelease – A framework for modeling the release of organic chemicals from the use and post-use of consumer products
SCOPUS_ID:85038106127;Time-series modeling of PV output for solar panels can help solar panel owners understand the power systems’ time-varying behavior and be prepared for the load demand. The time-series forecast/prediction can become challenging due to many missing observations or a lack of historical records that are not sufficient to establish statistical models. Increasing PV measurement frequency over a longer period increases the cost in the detection of the PV fluctuation. This paper proposes an efficient approach to iterative multi-task learning for time series (MTL-GP-TS) that improves prediction of the PV output without increasing measurement efforts by sharing the information among PV data from multiple similar solar panels. The proposed iterative MTL-GP-TS model learns/imputes unobserved or missing values in a dataset of time series associated with the solar panel of interest to predict the PV trend. Additionally, the method improves and generalizes the traditional multi-task learning for Gaussian Process to the learning of both global trend and local irregular components in time series. A real-world case study demonstrated that the proposed method could result in substantial improvement of predictions over conventional approaches. The paper also discusses the selection of parameters and data sources when implementing the proposed algorithm.;Shireen T.;2018-02-15;Iterative multi-task learning for time-series modeling of solar panel PV outputs
SCOPUS_ID:85037134079;"Background and objective
                  The Accident and Emergency Department (A&ED) is the frontline for providing emergency care in hospitals. Unfortunately, relative A&ED resources have failed to keep up with continuously increasing demand in recent years, which leads to overcrowding in A&ED. Knowing the fluctuation of patient arrival volume in advance is a significant premise to relieve this pressure. Based on this motivation, the objective of this study is to explore an integrated framework with high accuracy for predicting A&ED patient flow under different triage levels, by combining a novel feature selection process with deep neural networks.
               
               
                  Methods
                  Administrative data is collected from an actual A&ED and categorized into five groups based on different triage levels. A genetic algorithm (GA)-based feature selection algorithm is improved and implemented as a pre-processing step for this time-series prediction problem, in order to explore key features affecting patient flow. In our improved GA, a fitness-based crossover is proposed to maintain the joint information of multiple features during iterative process, instead of traditional point-based crossover. Deep neural networks (DNN) is employed as the prediction model to utilize their universal adaptability and high flexibility. In the model-training process, the learning algorithm is well-configured based on a parallel stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Two effective regularization strategies are integrated in one DNN framework to avoid overfitting. All introduced hyper-parameters are optimized efficiently by grid-search in one pass.
               
               
                  Results
                  As for feature selection, our improved GA-based feature selection algorithm has outperformed a typical GA and four state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms (mRMR, SAFS, VIFR, and CFR). As for the prediction accuracy of proposed integrated framework, compared with other frequently used statistical models (GLM, seasonal-ARIMA, ARIMAX, and ANN) and modern machine models (SVM-RBF, SVM-linear, RF, and R-LASSO), the proposed integrated “DNN-I-GA” framework achieves higher prediction accuracy on both MAPE and RMSE metrics in pairwise comparisons.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  The contribution of our study is two-fold. Theoretically, the traditional GA-based feature selection process is improved to have less hyper-parameters and higher efficiency, and the joint information of multiple features is maintained by fitness-based crossover operator. The universal property of DNN is further enhanced by merging different regularization strategies. Practically, features selected by our improved GA can be used to acquire an underlying relationship between patient flows and input features. Predictive values are significant indicators of patients' demand and can be used by A&ED managers to make resource planning and allocation. High accuracy achieved by the present framework in different cases enhances the reliability of downstream decision makings.";Jiang S.;2018-02-01;A universal deep learning approach for modeling the flow of patients under different severities
SCOPUS_ID:85030096149;This paper describes how Machine Learning and Robust Optimization techniques can greatly improve cash logistics operations. Specifically, we seek to optimize the logistics followed by the different branches of a given bank. Machine Learning is used to forecast cash demands for each of the branches, taking into account past demands and calendar effects. These demand predictions are forwarded to a Robust Optimization model, whose outputs are the cash transports that each branch should request. These transports guarantee that demand is fulfilled up to the desired confidence level, while also satisfying additional constraints arising in this particular domain.;Lopez Lazaro J.;2018-02-01;Improving cash logistics in bank branches by coupling machine learning and robust optimization
SCOPUS_ID:85034661580;"The uncertainty analysis and modeling of wind speed, which has an essential influence on wind power systems, is consistently considered a challenging task. However, most investigations thus far were focused mainly on point forecasts, which in reality cannot facilitate quantitative characterization of the endogenous uncertainty involved. An analysis-forecast system that includes an analysis module and a forecast module and can provide appropriate scenarios for the dispatching and scheduling of a power system is devised in this study; this system superior to those presented in previous studies. In order to qualitatively and quantitatively investigate the uncertainty of wind speed, recurrence analysis techniques are effectively developed for application in the analysis module. Furthermore, in order to quantify the uncertainty accurately, a novel architecture aimed at uncertainty mining is devised for the forecast module, where a non-parametric model optimized by an improved multi-objective water cycle algorithm is considered a predictor for producing intervals for each mode component after feature selection. The results of extensive in-depth experiments show that the devised system is not only superior to the considered benchmark models, but also has good potential practical applications in wind power systems.";Wang J.;2018-02-01;An analysis-forecast system for uncertainty modeling of wind speed: A case study of large-scale wind farms
SCOPUS_ID:85030764780;Big data applications usually need to rent a large number of virtual machines from Cloud computing providers. As a result of the policies employed by Cloud providers, the prices of spot virtual machine instances behavior stochastically. Spot prices (prices of spot instances) fluctuate greatly or have multiple regimes. Choosing virtual machines according to trends in prices is helpful in decreasing the resource rental cost. Existing price prediction methods are unable to accurately predict prices in these environments. As a result, a dynamic-ARIMA and two markov regime-switching autoregressive model based forecasting methods have been developed in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposals are better than the existing MonthAR in most scenarios.;Cai Z.;2018-02-01;Price forecasting for spot instances in Cloud computing
