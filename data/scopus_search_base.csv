SCOPUS_ID:85035128299,"This study develops a stochastic approach to the short-term forecasting of hotel booking arrivals. We investigate the key characteristics of booking arrivals, specifically the time-varying arrivals rates, high variability in the final demand, and the strong positive correlations between arrivals in different time periods. We examine three Poisson mixture models to capture these salient features of booking arrivals. In particular, the presence of strong inter-temporal correlations can be leveraged for forecasting future arrivals based on the early realizations. We suggest a new forecasting method that exploits the intrinsic correlations between early and late bookings and then present validation results of data from a major hotel chain along with a comparison to benchmark models. Our empirical study confirms that our dynamic updating method leveraging inter-temporal correlations can significantly improve the short-term forecasting accuracy of hotel room demand.",Lee M.,2018-06-01,Modeling and forecasting hotel room demand based on advance booking information

SCOPUS_ID:85036467319,"Cloud computing has drastically transformed the means of computing in recent years. In spite of numerous benefits, it suffers from some challenges too. Major challenges of cloud computing include dynamic resource scaling and power consumption. These factors lead a cloud system to become inefficient and costly. The workload prediction is one of the variables by which the efficiency and operational cost of a cloud can be improved. Accuracy is the key component in workload prediction and the existing approaches lag in producing 100% accurate results. The researchers are also putting their consistent efforts for its improvement. In this paper, we present a workload prediction model using neural network and self adaptive differential evolution algorithm. The model is capable of learning the best suitable mutation strategy along with optimal crossover rate. The experiments were performed on the benchmark data sets of NASA and Saskatchewan servers’ HTTP traces for different prediction intervals. We compared the results with prediction model based on well known back propagation learning algorithm and received significant improvement. The proposed model attained a shift up to 168 times in the error reduction and prediction error is reduced up to 0.001.",Kumar J.,2018-04-01,Workload prediction in cloud using artificial neural network and adaptive differential evolution

However, while user-provided photos embedded in online reviews accumulate in large quantities, their informational value has not been well understood likely due to technical challenges. The goal of this study is to introduce deep learning for computer vision to understand information value of online hotel reviews. Using a dataset collected from two social media sites, we compared deep learning models with other machine learning techniques to examine the effect of user-provided photos on review helpfulness. Findings show that deep learning models were more useful in predicting review helpfulness than other models. While user-provided photos alone did not have the same impact as review texts, combining review texts and user-provided photos produced the highest performance. Implications for the applications of deep learning technologies in hospitality and tourism research, as well as limitations and directions for future research, are discussed.",Ma Y.,2018-04-01,Effects of user-provided photos on hotel review helpfulness: An analytical approach with deep leaning
SCOPUS_ID:85034053217,"In this paper a new hybrid method combining variational mode decomposition (VMD) and single or Multi-kernel regularized pseudo inverse neural network (MKRPINN) is presented for effective and efficient wind power forecasting. The original non-linear and non-stationary time series data is decomposed using VMD approach to prevent the mutual effects among the different modes. The proposed VMD-KRPINN (VMD based kernel regularized pseudo inverse neural network) and VMD-MKRPINN methods are then used to predict wind power generation of a wind farm in the state of Wyoming, USA for different time intervals of 10 min, 30 min, 1 h and 3 h ahead. Comparison with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based kernel regularized pseudo inverse neural networks is also presented in the paper to validate the superiority of the VMD based wind power prediction models. Also to improve the performance of the proposed EMD-MKPRINN and VMD-MKRPINN models, their parameters are optimized using vaporization and precipitation based water cycle algorithm (VAPWCA).

SCOPUS_ID:85034648827,"Optimal PV based EV charging is performed either by predicting or by measuring PV output. However, due to the uncertainties associated with the variables involved, both the charging methods are not only disposed to significant voltage limit violations but also may cause PV energy harvest reduction. Hence, a methodology is proposed in this paper, which utilizes the measured PV output of a given sample and the supplied historical ramp to predict the PV output of the immediate next sample using a non-iterative method. The charging rates of the EV population are, subsequently, adjusted in the interval between the successive samples based on the predicted PV output with the help of a proposed SOC based charging strategy. The proposed methodology has been tested at the University of Queensland (UQ)’s solar and parking facilities coupled with its electric grid. The results show that aside from reducing the probability of voltage limit violations (PVV), the proposed methodology can increase the PV energy harvest. Moreover, it is cost-effective as compared to the conventional method such as onsite battery energy storage deployment.",Islam M.S.,2018-04-01,PV based EV charging at universities using supplied historical PV output ramp

However, quantifying the amount of chemicals released during the use and post-use phases of consumer products is challenging, limiting the ability to understand their impacts. Here we present a comprehensive framework, OrganoRelease, for estimating the release of organic chemicals from the use and post-use of consumer products given limited information.

SCOPUS_ID:85038106127,"Time-series modeling of PV output for solar panels can help solar panel owners understand the power systems’ time-varying behavior and be prepared for the load demand. The time-series forecast/prediction can become challenging due to many missing observations or a lack of historical records that are not sufficient to establish statistical models. Increasing PV measurement frequency over a longer period increases the cost in the detection of the PV fluctuation. This paper proposes an efficient approach to iterative multi-task learning for time series (MTL-GP-TS) that improves prediction of the PV output without increasing measurement efforts by sharing the information among PV data from multiple similar solar panels. The proposed iterative MTL-GP-TS model learns/imputes unobserved or missing values in a dataset of time series associated with the solar panel of interest to predict the PV trend. Additionally, the method improves and generalizes the traditional multi-task learning for Gaussian Process to the learning of both global trend and local irregular components in time series. A real-world case study demonstrated that the proposed method could result in substantial improvement of predictions over conventional approaches. The paper also discusses the selection of parameters and data sources when implementing the proposed algorithm.",Shireen T.,2018-02-15,Iterative multi-task learning for time-series modeling of solar panel PV outputs
SCOPUS_ID:85037134079,"Background and objective
                  The Accident and Emergency Department (A&ED) is the frontline for providing emergency care in hospitals. Unfortunately, relative A&ED resources have failed to keep up with continuously increasing demand in recent years, which leads to overcrowding in A&ED. Knowing the fluctuation of patient arrival volume in advance is a significant premise to relieve this pressure. Based on this motivation, the objective of this study is to explore an integrated framework with high accuracy for predicting A&ED patient flow under different triage levels, by combining a novel feature selection process with deep neural networks.
               
               
                  Methods
                  Administrative data is collected from an actual A&ED and categorized into five groups based on different triage levels. A genetic algorithm (GA)-based feature selection algorithm is improved and implemented as a pre-processing step for this time-series prediction problem, in order to explore key features affecting patient flow. In our improved GA, a fitness-based crossover is proposed to maintain the joint information of multiple features during iterative process, instead of traditional point-based crossover. Deep neural networks (DNN) is employed as the prediction model to utilize their universal adaptability and high flexibility. In the model-training process, the learning algorithm is well-configured based on a parallel stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Two effective regularization strategies are integrated in one DNN framework to avoid overfitting. All introduced hyper-parameters are optimized efficiently by grid-search in one pass.
               
               
                  Results
                  As for feature selection, our improved GA-based feature selection algorithm has outperformed a typical GA and four state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms (mRMR, SAFS, VIFR, and CFR). As for the prediction accuracy of proposed integrated framework, compared with other frequently used statistical models (GLM, seasonal-ARIMA, ARIMAX, and ANN) and modern machine models (SVM-RBF, SVM-linear, RF, and R-LASSO), the proposed integrated “DNN-I-GA” framework achieves higher prediction accuracy on both MAPE and RMSE metrics in pairwise comparisons.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  The contribution of our study is two-fold. Theoretically, the traditional GA-based feature selection process is improved to have less hyper-parameters and higher efficiency, and the joint information of multiple features is maintained by fitness-based crossover operator. The universal property of DNN is further enhanced by merging different regularization strategies. Practically, features selected by our improved GA can be used to acquire an underlying relationship between patient flows and input features. Predictive values are significant indicators of patients' demand and can be used by A&ED managers to make resource planning and allocation. High accuracy achieved by the present framework in different cases enhances the reliability of downstream decision makings.",Jiang S.,2018-02-01,A universal deep learning approach for modeling the flow of patients under different severities

SCOPUS_ID:85034661580,"The uncertainty analysis and modeling of wind speed, which has an essential influence on wind power systems, is consistently considered a challenging task. However, most investigations thus far were focused mainly on point forecasts, which in reality cannot facilitate quantitative characterization of the endogenous uncertainty involved. An analysis-forecast system that includes an analysis module and a forecast module and can provide appropriate scenarios for the dispatching and scheduling of a power system is devised in this study; this system superior to those presented in previous studies. In order to qualitatively and quantitatively investigate the uncertainty of wind speed, recurrence analysis techniques are effectively developed for application in the analysis module. Furthermore, in order to quantify the uncertainty accurately, a novel architecture aimed at uncertainty mining is devised for the forecast module, where a non-parametric model optimized by an improved multi-objective water cycle algorithm is considered a predictor for producing intervals for each mode component after feature selection.

SCOPUS_ID:85037983717,"Energy consumption for hot water production is a major draw in high efficiency buildings. Optimizing this has typically been approached from a thermodynamics perspective, decoupled from occupant influence. Furthermore, optimization usually presupposes existence of a detailed dynamics model for the hot water system. These assumptions lead to suboptimal energy efficiency in the real world. In this paper, we present a novel reinforcement learning based methodology which optimizes hot water production. The proposed methodology is completely generalizable, and does not require an offline step or human domain knowledge to build a model for the hot water vessel or the heating element. Occupant preferences too are learnt on the fly. The proposed system is applied to a set of 32 houses in the Netherlands where it reduces energy consumption for hot water production by roughly 20% with no loss of occupant comfort. Extrapolating, this translates to absolute savings of roughly 200 kWh for a single household on an annual basis. This performance can be replicated to any domestic hot water system and optimization objective, given that the fairly minimal requirements on sensor data are met.

SCOPUS_ID:85036461446,"Motivated by the increasing integration among electricity markets, in this paper we propose two different methods to incorporate market integration in electricity price forecasting and to improve the predictive performance. First, we propose a deep neural network that considers features from connected markets to improve the predictive accuracy in a local market. To measure the importance of these features, we propose a novel feature selection algorithm that, by using Bayesian optimization and functional analysis of variance, evaluates the effect of the features on the algorithm performance. In addition, using market integration, we propose a second model that, by simultaneously predicting prices from two markets, improves the forecasting accuracy even further. As a case study, we consider the electricity market in Belgium and the improvements in forecasting accuracy when using various French electricity features. We show that the two proposed models lead to improvements that are statistically significant. Particularly, due to market integration, the predictive accuracy is improved from 15.7% to 12.5% sMAPE (symmetric mean absolute percentage error).

SCOPUS_ID:85031110924,"Wind speed forecasting plays a prominent part in the operation of wind power plants and power systems. However, it is often difficult to obtain satisfactory prediction results because wind speed data comprise random nonlinear series. Current some statistical models are not proficient in predicting nonlinear time series, whereas artificial intelligence models often fall into local optima. For these reasons, a novel combined forecasting model, which combines hybrid models based on decomposed methods and optimization algorithms, is successfully developed with variable weighting combination theory for multi-step wind speed forecasting. In this model, three different hybrid models are proposed and to further improve the forecasting performance, a modified support vector regression is used to integrate all the results obtained by each hybrid model and obtain the final forecasting results. To verify the forecasting effectiveness of the proposed forecasting model, 10-min wind speed series from Penglai, China, are used as case studies.

SCOPUS_ID:85037040177,"Irradiance received on the earth’s surface is the main factor that affects the output power of solar PV plants, and is chiefly determined by the cloud distribution seen in a ground-based sky image at the corresponding moment in time. It is the foundation for those linear extrapolation-based ultra-short-term solar PV power forecasting approaches to obtain the cloud distribution in future sky images from the accurate calculation of cloud motion displacement vectors (CMDVs) by using historical sky images. Theoretically, the CMDV can be obtained from the coordinate of the peak pulse calculated from a Fourier phase correlation theory (FPCT) method through the frequency domain information of sky images. The peak pulse is significant and unique only when the cloud deformation between two consecutive sky images is slight enough, which is likely possible for a very short time interval (such as 1 min or shorter) with common changes in the speed of cloud. Sometimes, there will be more than one pulse with similar values when the deformation of the clouds between two consecutive sky images is comparatively obvious under fast changing cloud speeds. This would probably lead to significant errors if the CMDVs were still only obtained from the single coordinate of the peak value pulse. However, the deformation estimation of clouds between two images and its influence on FPCT-based CMDV calculations are terrifically complex and difficult because the motion of clouds is complicated to describe and model. Therefore, to improve the accuracy and reliability under these circumstances in a simple manner, an image-phase-shift-invariance (IPSI) based CMDV calculation method using FPCT is proposed for minute time scale solar power forecasting. First, multiple different CMDVs are calculated from the corresponding consecutive images pairs obtained through different synchronous rotation angles compared to the original images by using the FPCT method. Second, the final CMDV is generated from all of the calculated CMDVs through a centroid iteration strategy based on its density and distance distribution. Third, the influence of different rotation angle resolution on the final CMDV is analyzed as a means of parameter estimation. Simulations under various scenarios including both thick and thin clouds conditions indicated that the proposed IPSI-based CMDV calculation method using FPCT is more accurate and reliable than the original FPCT method, optimal flow (OF) method, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) method.",Wang F.,2018-02-01,Image phase shift invariance based cloud motion displacement vector calculation method for ultra-short-term solar PV power forecasting

EESS are recognized as a key technology to overcome this challenge by storing energy and converting it back when needed. Even though some EESS solutions are already available on the market, EESS suffer from technical limitations and entail high investment costs.

SCOPUS_ID:85032939165,"Broadly speaking, building energy use prediction can be classified into two categories based on modeling approaches namely engineering and Artificial Intelligence (AI). While engineering approach requires solving physical equations representing the thermal performance of systems and components that constitute the buildings, the AI-based approach uses historical data to predict future performance. Although engineering approach estimates energy use with greater accuracy, it falls short in the overall complexity of model building and simulation in which detailed data that represent the building geometry, systems, configurations, and occupant schedule is needed. Whereas, the AI-based approach offers a rapid prediction of building energy use and, if appropriately trained and tested, may be used for quick and efficient decision-making of energy use reduction. Nevertheless, for robust integration with and to improve automated building systems management and intelligence, the need for consistent, stable, and higher prediction accuracy cannot be understated. To alleviate the instability issue, and to improve prediction accuracy, we have exploited and tested an ensemble learning technique, ‘Ensemble Bagging Trees’ (EBT), using data obtained from meteorological systems and building-level occupancy and meters.Results showed that the proposed EBT model predicted hourly electricity demand of the test building with improved accuracy of Mean Absolute Prediction Error that ranged from 2.97% to 4.63%.

The short-term heating load prediction model can help management staff of buildings obtain hourly heating demand in advance and optimally arrange the operation of HVAC systems. The ultra-short-term heating load prediction model can be used for the prediction of a large load fluctuation, which may occur, and for the improvement of the operational safety of HVAC systems. Wavelet decomposition and reconstruction (WD), correlation analysis (CA), and principal component analysis (PCA) are employed to obtain reasonable model inputs, and two machine learning methods, namely the multilayer layer perceptron neural network (MLP) and the support vector regression (SVR), are used to establish the prediction models. The mean relative error (MRE) of the short-term heating load and ultra-short-term heating load prediction models reach 10.7% and 6.0%, respectively. The importance of the interior and exterior variables that influenced the building heating load is compared and the conclusion is that the building heating load is mainly influenced by exterior variables; however, the addition of the interior variables may help obtain more accurate heating load prediction models.",Ding Y.,2018-01-15,Model input selection for building heating load prediction: A case study for an office building in Tianjin
SCOPUS_ID:85035312215,"Wind energy is attracting more attention with the growing demand for energy. However, the efficient development and utilization of wind energy are restricted due to the intermittency and randomness of wind speed. Although abundant investigations concerning wind speed forecasting have been conducted by numerous researchers, most of the studies merely attach importance to point forecasts, which cannot quantitatively characterize the uncertainties as developing intervals. In this study, a novel interval prediction architecture has been designed, aiming at constructing effective prediction intervals for a wind speed series, composed of a preprocessing module, a feature selection module, an optimization module, a forecast module and an evaluation module. The feature selection module, in cooperation with the preprocessing module, is developed to determine the optimal model input. Furthermore, the forecast module optimized by the optimization module is considered a predictor for giving prediction intervals. The experimental results shed light on the architecture that not only outperforms the benchmark models considered, but also has great potential for application to wind power systems.",Niu T.,2018-01-15,Uncertainty modeling for chaotic time series based on optimal multi-input multi-output architecture: Application to offshore wind speed
SCOPUS_ID:85035116145,"Solar photovoltaic plants are widely integrated into most countries worldwide. Due to the ever-growing utilization of solar photovoltaic plants, either via grid-connection or stand-alone networks, dramatic changes can be anticipated in both power system planning and operating stages. Solar photovoltaic integration requires the capability of handling the uncertainty and fluctuations of power output. In this case, solar photovoltaic power forecasting is a crucial aspect to ensure optimum planning and modelling of the solar photovoltaic plants. Accurate forecasting provides the grid operators and power system designers with significant information to design an optimal solar photovoltaic plant as well as managing the power of demand and supply. This paper presents an extensive review on recent advancements in the field of solar photovoltaic power forecasting. This paper aims to analyze and compare various methods of solar photovoltaic power forecasting in terms of characteristics and performance. This work classifies solar photovoltaic power forecasting methods into three major categories i.e., time-series statistical methods, physical methods, and ensemble methods. To date, Artificial Intelligence approaches are widely used due to their capability in solving the non-linear and complex structure of data. The performance analysis shows that these methods outperform the traditional methods. Recently, the ensemble methods were also developed by researchers to extract the unique features of single models to enhance the forecast model performances. This combination produces accurate results compared to individual models. This paper also elaborates on the metrics assessment which was implemented to evaluate the forecast model performances. This work provides information which is beneficial for researchers and engineers who are involved in the modelling and planning of the solar photovoltaic plant.",Sobri S.,2018-01-15,Solar photovoltaic generation forecasting methods: A review
SCOPUS_ID:85035127514,"Wind power is one of the most promising powers. Wind speed forecasting can eliminate the harmful effect caused by the intermittent and fluctuation of wind power, and big multi-step forecasting can provide more time for the power grid to be adjusted. To achieve the high-precision big multi-step forecasting, a novel hybrid model named as the WD-SampEn-VMD-MadaBoost-BFGS-WF is proposed in the study, which consisting of three main modeling steps including the secondary decomposition, the ensemble method and the error correction. The detail of the proposed model is given as follows: (a) wind speed series are decomposed by the WD (Wavelet Decomposition) to obtain wind speed subseries. The SampEn (Sample Entropy) algorithm is used to estimate the unpredictability of these wind speed subseries. The most unpredictable subseries will be decomposed secondarily by the VMD (Variational Mode Decomposition); (b) the subseries are proceeded by the MAdaBoost (Modified AdaBoost.RT) with the BFGS (Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno Quasi-Newton Back Propagation) neuron network to obtain forecasting subseries; (c) all of the forecasting subseries will be combined with the original subseries to form the combined wind speed series, which will be further proceeded by the WF (Wavelet Filter) to obtain the corrected forecasting series from the point of the frequency domain; (d) the corrected forecasting series are reconstructed to get the final forecasting series. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, several forecasting cases are provided in the study. The result indicates that the proposed model has satisfactory forecasting performance in the big multi-step extremely strong simulating wind speed forecasting.",Liu H.,2018-01-15,"Big multi-step wind speed forecasting model based on secondary decomposition, ensemble method and error correction algorithm"
SCOPUS_ID:85034071010,"Food service operations in an all-you-care-to-eat environment need to consider two conflicting objectives: a desire to reduce overproduction food waste (and its corresponding environmental impacts), and an aversion to shortfalls (in which some customer demands go unsatisfied). A particular challenge in such buffet-style operations is the absence of any lost marginal revenue associated with lost sales that can be used to measure the shortfall cost, complicating any attempt to determine a minimum-cost solution. This research presents a multi-criteria optimization approach to identify the efficient frontier of points lying between the minimum-waste and minimum-shortfall solutions. In particular, we identify optimal production adjustments relative to demand forecasts, demand thresholds for utilization of leftovers, and percentages of demand to be satisfied by leftovers, considering two alternative metrics for overproduction waste: mass; and greenhouse gas emissions (to account for the embodied chemical usage during farming, transportation, and landfill decomposing of overproduced food waste). A statistical analysis of the changes in decision variable values across each of the efficient frontiers can then be performed to identify the key variables that could be modified to reduce the amount of wasted food at minimal increase in shortfalls (or, alternatively, to reduce the amount of shortfalls at minimal increase in waste). We illustrate our approach with an application to empirical data from Campus Dining Services operations at the University of Missouri. Our analysis suggests that targeted production level modifications, rather than blanket increases or decreases, can allow food service providers to reduce overproduction food waste without significant increases in demand shortfalls.",Birisci E.,2018-01-10,Optimal production planning utilizing leftovers for an all-you-care-to-eat food service operation
SCOPUS_ID:85034594326,"Severe environmental problems are resulted from the rapid growth of electricity consumption in China, since thermal power plant occupies the predominant position in power generation and releases large amount of pollutants and greenhouse gas. Electricity consumption of residential sector grows even faster than that of industrial sector in recent years. Residential sector is increasingly believed to have huge potential of energy saving and efficiency improvement. This paper aims at discovering the regional difference of household electricity consumption (HEC). First, a research framework is provided to identify the characteristics of HEC from the following three dimensions, consumption volatility, pattern similarity and temperature sensitivity. Households are divided into different groups in each city. The major household groups that account for the largest proportion are identified and then regarded as representatives of different cities. The fluctuation characteristics of their typical load profiles are compared and discussed in detail. Moreover, we design an Empty City Index (ECI) to further discuss the relationship between HEC and the population flow in special time intervals, for example, Chinese Spring Festival. The empirical study demonstrates that population outflow during Spring Festival is more obvious in wealthier city. Through k-means clustering, typical household groups as well as their typical load profiles are identified in each city. And the results show that under the current tiered pricing for household electricity (TPHE), nearly 10% households in each city still have potential for load reduction and load shifting. For the entire Jiangsu province, such households account for 12.5%. Policy implications and the applicability of this study are suggested and discussed respectively to government, household customers and electric power companies.",Sun L.,2018-01-10,"Regional difference of household electricity consumption: An empirical study of Jiangsu, China"

SCOPUS_ID:85031499052,"Real-time occupancy predictions are essential components for the smart buildings in the imminent future. The occupancy information, such as the presence states and the occupants’ number, allows a robust control of the indoor environment to enhance the building energy performances. With many current studies focusing on the commercial building occupancy, most researchers modeled either the occupancy presence or the occupants’ number without evaluating the model potentials on both of them. This study focuses on 1) providing a unique data set containing the occupancy for the offices located in the U.S with difference pattern varieties, 2) proposing two methods, then comparing them with four existing methods, and 3) both presence of occupancy and occupancy number are predicted and tested using the approaches proposed in this study. In detail, the paper develops a new moving-window inhomogeneous Markov model based on change point analysis. A hierarchical probability sampling model is modified based on existed models. They are additional compared to well-known models from previous researchers. The study further explores and evaluates the predictive power of the models by various temporal scenarios, including 15-min ahead, 30-min ahead, 1-h ahead, and 24-h ahead forecasts. The final results show that the proposed Markov model outperforms the other methods with a max 22% difference in terms of presence forecasts for 15-min, 30min and 1-h ahead. The proposed Markov model also outperforms other models in occupancy number prediction for all forecast windows with 0.34 RMSE and 0.23 MAE error respectively. However, there is not much performance difference between models for 24-h ahead predictions of occupancy presence forecast.",Li Z.,2018-01-01,Short term predictions of occupancy in commercial buildings—Performance analysis for stochastic models and machine learning approaches

They assist renewable and conventional energy engineers, electricity providers, end-users, and government entities in addressing energy sustainability challenges for the National Electricity Market (NEM) in Australia, including the expansion of distribution networks, energy pricing, and policy development. In this study, data-driven techniques for forecasting short-term (24-h) G-data are adopted using 0.5 h, 1.0 h, and 24 h forecasting horizons. These techniques are based on the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. This study is focused in Queensland, Australia’s second largest state, where end-user demand for energy continues to increase. To determine the MARS and SVR model inputs, the partial autocorrelation function is applied to historical (area aggregated) G data in the training period to discriminate the significant (lagged) inputs. On the other hand, single input G data is used to develop the univariate ARIMA model. The predictors are based on statistically significant lagged inputs and partitioned into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets to construct the forecasting models. The accuracy of the G forecasts, with respect to the measured G data, is assessed using statistical metrics such as the Pearson Product-Moment Correlation coefficient (r), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

SCOPUS_ID:85023606652,"Water demand forecasting in water supply systems is one of the basic strategic management tasks of water supplying companies. This is done using specially designed water consumption models which generate data necessary for planning operational activities. A high number of water demand forecasting methods proposed in the literature points to the complexity and significance of the problem for current operation of water supplying companies. However, it must be observed that no universal method applicable to any water supply system has been developed so far. In addition to this, there is no method which could be considered referential relative to other methods. For this reason, it is necessary to continue the research on forecasting methods enabling effective forecasts based on suitably selected sets of input quantities. This paper proposes a solution for water consumption forecasting in a water supply system, wherein hourly water consumption is determined by trend analysis and harmonic analysis. Trend analysis consists in estimating parameters of models for individual phases of a cycle, while harmonic analysis is based on the assumption that a time series consists of sine and cosine waves with different frequencies known as harmonics.

SCOPUS_ID:85028016495,"To mitigate the impact of climate change and global warming, the use of renewable energies is increasing day by day significantly. A considerable amount of electricity is generated from renewable energy sources since the last decade. Among the potential renewable energies, photovoltaic (PV) has experienced enormous growth in electricity generation. A large number of PV systems have been installed in on-grid and off-grid systems in the last few years. The number of PV systems will increase rapidly in the future due to the policies of the government and international organizations, and the advantages of PV technology. However, the variability of PV power generation creates different negative impacts on the electric grid system, such as the stability, reliability, and planning of the operation, aside from the economic benefits. Therefore, accurate forecasting of PV power generation is significantly important to stabilize and secure grid operation and promote large-scale PV power integration. A good number of research has been conducted to forecast PV power generation in different perspectives. This paper made a comprehensive and systematic review of the direct forecasting of PV power generation. The importance of the correlation of the input-output data and the preprocessing of model input data are discussed. This review covers the performance analysis of several PV power forecasting models based on different classifications.

Experimental measurements of this property for different nanoparticles and base fluids at various temperatures is cumbersome and expensive. In this communication, a comprehensive review of the most important modeling works on viscosity of nanofluids including theoretical models, empirical correlations, and computer-aided models is conducted. Next, four multilayer perceptron (MLP) models optimized with Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), Bayesian Regularization (BR), Scaled conjugate gradient (SCG), and Resilient Backpropagation (RB), two radial basis function (RBF) neural network models optimized with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and one least square support vector machine (LSSVM) model optimized with coupled simulated annealing (CSA) were developed for the prediction of nanofluid viscosity based on 3144 data points. These data sets include 42 nanofluid systems under a wide range of operating conditions; including temperature from −35 to 80°C, particle volume fraction from 0% to 10%, nanoparticle size from 4.6 to 190nm, and viscosity of base fluid from 0.24 to 452.6cP. Then, these seven models were combined in a single model using a committee machine intelligent system (CMIS). The proposed CMIS predicts all of the data with excellent accuracy with an average absolute relative error of less than 4%. Furthermore, the developed model was compared with five theoretical models and four empirical correlations through statistical and graphical error analyses. The results demonstrate that the proposed CMIS model significantly outperforms all of the existing models and correlations in terms of accuracy and range of validity.

SCOPUS_ID:85029783595,"Together with the increasing population and urbanization, cities have started to face challenges that hinder their socio-economic and sustainable development. The concept of smart cities, therefore, has emerged during the last years as a response to these problems. Advanced measurement and communication technologies enabled through smart cities have particularly played a key role in dealing with such economic, social and organizational challenges faced during the growing of cities. In this sense, using historical information provided with the mentioned technologies, various forecasting tools have been incorporated into smart city environment in order to manage more effectively its essential components such as smart grids and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). For a further improvement in forecasting accuracy and hence in the management of these smart systems, recently, the information available in space has been also introduced in forecasting tools in addition to that in time. These advanced forecasting approaches, called spatio-temporal methods, have the capability of making use of all the available data collected from different locations. The potential benefits of these approaches have been underlined in various recent studies in the literature. In this paper, a comprehensive overview and assessment of forecasting approaches including both spatial and temporal information have been presented for the purpose of supporting the ongoing efforts for exploiting the available information in smart city applications. With this objective, the spatio-temporal forecasting methods presented in the literature are classified considering their implementation areas and model structures.

SCOPUS_ID:85020268535,"tAccurate forecasting simultaneously becomes more important and more challenging due to the increasing penetration of photovoltaic (PV) systems in the built environment on the one hand, and the increasing stochastic nature of electricity consumption, e.g., through electric vehicles (EVs), on the other hand. Until recently, research has mainly focused on deterministic forecasting. However, such forecasts convey little information about the possible future state of a system and since a forecast is inherently erroneous, it is important to quantify this error. This paper therefore focuses on the recent advances in the area of probabilistic forecasting of solar power (PSPF) and load forecasting (PLF). The goal of a probabilistic forecast is to provide either a complete predictive density of the future state or to predict that the future state of a system will fall in an interval, defined by a confidence level. The aim of this paper is to analyze the state of the art and assess the different approaches in terms of their performance, but also to what extent these approaches can be generalized so that they not only perform best on the data set for which they were designed, but also on other data sets or different case studies. In addition, growing interest in net demand forecasting, i.e., demand less generation, is another important motivation to combine PSPF and PLF into one review paper and assess compatibility. One important finding is that there is no single preferred model that can be applied to any circumstance. In fact, a study has shown that the same model, with adapted parameters, applied to different case studies performed well but did not excel, when compared to models that were optimized for the specific task. Furthermore, there is need for standardization, in particular in terms of filtering night time data, normalizing results and performance metrics.",van der Meer D.W.,2018-01-01,Review on probabilistic forecasting of photovoltaic power production and electricity consumption
SCOPUS_ID:85034096390,"The accurate forecasting of future container throughput is important for the construction, upgrade, and operation management of a port. This study introduces group method of data handling (GMDH) neural network and proposes a hybrid forecasting model based on GMDH (HFMG) to forecast container throughput. This model decomposes the original container throughput series into two parts: linear trend and nonlinear variation, and uses the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) approach to predict the linear trend. Considering the complexity of forecasting nonlinear subseries, the proposed model adopts three nonlinear single models, namely, support vector regression (SVR), back-propagation (BP) neural network, and genetic programming (GP), to predict the nonlinear subseries. Then, the model establishes selective combination forecasting by the GMDH neural network on the nonlinear subseries and obtains its combination forecasting results. Finally, the predictions of two parts are integrated to obtain the forecasting results of the original container throughput time series. The container throughput data of Xiamen and Shanghai Ports in China are used for empirical analysis, and the results show that the forecasting performance of the HFMG model is better than that of SARIMA model, as well as some hybrid forecasting models, such as SARIMA-SVR, SARIMA-GP, and SARIMA-BP. Finally, the monthly out-of-sample forecasts of container throughput for the two ports throughout 2016 are given.",Mo L.,2018-01-01,GMDH-based hybrid model for container throughput forecasting: Selective combination forecasting in nonlinear subseries
SCOPUS_ID:85033384606,"Accurate, fast forecasting of hydro-meteorological time series is presently a major challenge in drought and flood mitigation. This paper proposes a hybrid approach, wavelet de-noising (WD) and Rank-Set Pair Analysis (RSPA), that takes full advantage of a combination of the two approaches to improve forecasts of hydro-meteorological time series. WD allows decomposition and reconstruction of a time series by the wavelet transform, and hence separation of the noise from the original series. RSPA, a more reliable and efficient version of Set Pair Analysis, is integrated with WD to form the hybrid WD-RSPA approach. Two types of hydro-meteorological data sets with different characteristics and different levels of human influences at some representative stations are used to illustrate the WD-RSPA approach. The approach is also compared to three other generic methods: the conventional Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) (BP-error Back Propagation, MLP-Multilayer Perceptron and RBF-Radial Basis Function), and RSPA alone. Nine error metrics are used to evaluate the model performance. Compared to three other generic methods, the results generated by WD-REPA model presented invariably smaller error measures which means the forecasting capability of the WD-REPA model is better than other models. The results show that WD-RSPA is accurate, feasible, and effective. In particular, WD-RSPA is found to be the best among the various generic methods compared in this paper, even when the extreme events are included within a time series.",Wang D.,2018-01-01,A hybrid wavelet de-noising and Rank-Set Pair Analysis approach for forecasting hydro-meteorological time series

SCOPUS_ID:85031504985,"Water resources systems face irreducible uncertainty in supply and demand, requiring policies to respond to changing conditions on multiple timescales. For both short-term operation and long-term adaptation, thresholds or “decision triggers”, where a policy links observed indicators to actions, have featured prominently in recent studies. There remains a need for a general method to conceptualize threshold-based policies in an easily interpretable structure, and a corresponding search algorithm to design them. Here we propose a conceptual and computational framework where policies are formulated as binary trees, using a simulation-optimization approach. Folsom Reservoir, California serves as an illustrative case study, where policies define the thresholds triggering flood control and conservation actions. Candidate operating rules are generated across an ensemble of climate scenarios, incorporating indicator variables describing longer-term climate shifts to investigate opportunities for adaptation.

The economic and environmental benefits of the hybrid electric vehicles are greatly reshaping the modern transportation sector. The transportation electrification (TE) brings various challenges to the Smart Grid (SG), such as power quality, reliability, and control. Thus, there is a need to explore and reveal the key enabling technologies for TE. Moreover, the intermittent nature of Renewable Energy Resources (RER) based generation demands for efficient, reliable, flexible, dynamic, and distributed energy storage technologies. The Electrical Vehicles (EVs) storage battery is the promising solution in accommodating RER based generation within SG. The most efficient feature of transportation sector is Vehicle to Grid (V2G) concept that will help in storing the surplus energy and feeding back this energy to the main grid during period of high demands. The storage technology is an integral part of the SG that helps in attaining the proper utilization of RER. In this paper, our goal is to explore the TE sector and its impact on economy, reliability and eco-friendly system. We reviewed the V2G technology and their implementation challenges. We further reviewed various energy storage technologies deployed in EVs within SG, considering attention to their influence on the environment. Moreover, this paper presented a detailed overview of the on board and off board charging infrastructure and communication necessities for EV.

SCOPUS_ID:85030656566,"Long-term windspeed prediction is crucial for establishing the viability of wind as a clean energy option, including the selection of wind farm locations, feasibility studies on energy potential and the operation of wind energy conversion systems with minimal investment risk. To deliver this vital societal need, data-inexpensive artificial intelligence models relying on historical inputs can be a useful scientific contrivance by energy analysts, engineers and climate-policy advocates. In this paper, a novel approach is adopted to construct a multilayer perceptron (MLP) hybrid model integrated with the Firefly Optimizer algorithm (MLP-FFA) trained with a limited set of historical (monthly) data (2004–2014) for a group of neighboring stations to predict windspeed at target sites in north-west Iran. Subsequently, the MLP-FFA model is developed to minimize the error rate of the resulting hybrid model and applied at each of the eight target sites one-by-one (namely: Tabriz, Jolfa, Sarab, Marand, Sahand, Kaleybar, Maraghe and Mianeh) such that the seven neighboring (reference) sites are used for training and the remainder eighth site for testing purposes. To ascertain conclusive results, the hybrid model's ability to predict windspeed at each target site is cross-validated with the MLP model without the FFA optimizer and the statistical performance is benchmarked with root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E
                     NS), Willmott's Index (d) and the Legates and McCabes Index (E
                     1), including relative errors. For all eight target sites, the testing performance of the MLP-FFA model is found to be significantly superior than the classical MLP, resulting in lower values of the RMSE (0.202–0.50 ms−1 relative to 0.236–0.664 ms−1) and larger values of E

Despite a more accurate performance of hybrid models tested at each target site, the preciseness registered a distinct geographic signature with the least accurate result (for Kaleybar) and the most accurate result (for Jolfa). To accord with this result, we conclude that the utilization of the FFA as an add-in optimizer in a hybrid data-intelligent model leads to a significant improvement in the predictive accuracy, presumably due to the optimal weights attained in the hidden layer that allows a more robust feature extraction process. Accordingly, we establish that the hybrid MLP-FFA model can be explored further in a problem of long-term windspeed prediction with reference station input data, and feasibility studies on wind energy investments in data-scarce regions where a limited set of neighboring reference site data can be employed to forecast the target site windspeed.",Deo R.C.,2018-01-01,Multi-layer perceptron hybrid model integrated with the firefly optimizer algorithm for windspeed prediction of target site using a limited set of neighboring reference station data
SCOPUS_ID:85016064264,"Direct digital manufacturing (DDM) is a combination of product modeling and manufacturing technology that directly converts digital models to physical objects without the need for tooling. The capability of DDM to improve the sustainability of products and processes is based on changing operational practices in product design, distribution, use, and after-sales services. Although research has provided evidence of the potential impact of DDM technologies, there is limited research on how specific DDM-based operational practices add to the operational capabilities of a manufacturer and how these capabilities can be used to improve sustainability outcomes. To address this research gap, we evaluate how current and future DDM-based operational practices can be used to improve products and processes. The analyzed current practices are in prototyping, tooling, on-demand parts manufacturing, and customized parts manufacturing. Two future practices that are evaluated are DDM-based incremental product improvement and dynamic supply chain reconfiguration.
                  Based on the evaluation of current and future practices, we propose a design theory for the introduction of DDM into manufacturing firms for improving sustainability capabilities. The key contribution of this article is specifying the mechanisms by which a specific DDM-based operational practice improves sustainability outcomes and how each practice creates an operational practice threshold that needs to be reached before further improvement of capabilities is possible. Thus, using the theory new operational practices can be proactively developed and tested before the next threshold is reached. This in turn will help manufacturers develop strategies and investment plans for current and future DDM-based practices and to accumulate sustainability capabilities faster.",Holmstrom J.,2018-01-01,Sustainability outcomes through direct digital manufacturing-based operational practices: A design theory approach

Eight input variables combinations are formed randomly and compared for prediction accuracy with ANN and SVM models. The training and testing data were obtained from an office building by field measurement. K-means and hierarchical clustering methods are applied to classify the input variables.

SCOPUS_ID:85028938939,"Buildings are one of the major sources of electricity and greenhouse gas emission (GHG) in urban areas all around the world. Since a large integration of solar energy is observed in the form of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) units, electricity use of buildings is highly uncertain due to intermittent nature of solar output power. This leads to poor energy management for both network operators and building owners. In addition, uncertain metrological conditions, diversity and complexity of buildings are big hurdles to accurate prediction of the demand. To improve accuracy of load demand forecast of PV integrated smart building, a hybrid ensemble framework is proposed in this paper. This is based on a combination of five different predictors named as backpropagation neural network (BPNN), Elman neural network (EN), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), feed forward neural network (FNN), radial basis function (RBF) and their wavelet transform (WT) models. WT is applied to historical load data to remove the spikes and fluctuations. FNN and RBF network were trained with particle swarm optimization (PSO) for higher forecast accuracy. The output of each predictor in the ensemble network is combined using Bayesian model averaging (BMA). The proposed framework is tested using real data of two practical PV integrated smart buildings in a big university environment. The results indicate that the proposed framework show improvement in average forecast normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) around 17% and 20% in seasonal daily and seasonal weekly case studies, respectively. In addition, proposed framework also produces lowest of nRMSE about 3.88% in seasonal monthly forecast of smart buildings with rooftop PV as compared to benchmark model.

SCOPUS_ID:85032810528,"Most of existing modeling methods are based on point prediction. However, the accuracy of point prediction cannot meet the actual demand due to existence of high noise, volatility, complexity and irregularity inherent in the chemical process data. In order to solve this problem, a hybrid high-quality prediction intervals (PIs) method integrating complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD), sample entropy (SE), and improved multi-kernel relevant vector machine (RVM) is proposed in the paper. The proposed PIs method mainly consists of three aspects: Firstly, CEEMD is adopted to decompose the original data into several independent intrinsic mode functions (IMFS), and then SE is used to analyze the complexity of the extracted IMFs to obtain recombinant components; Secondly, an improved multi-kernel RVM (MRVM) is presented to predict recombinant components independently, in which the linear kernel and the Gaussian kernel are combined; Thirdly, the predicted components are aggregated to obtain an ensemble result using another MRVM for constructing the high-quality PIs.

SCOPUS_ID:85034264561,"Wind energy is rapidly emerging as an appealing energy option because it is both abundant and environmentally friendly. Because of the stochastic nature and intrinsic complexity of wind speed, precise and reliable wind-speed prediction is vital for wind-farm planning and the operational planning of power grids. To improve wind-speed forecasting accuracy or stability, many forecasting approaches have been proposed. However, these models usually only consider one criterion (accuracy or stability) and have limitations associated with using individual models. In this paper, an ensemble method optimized by a novel multi-objective optimization algorithm is introduced. With respect to ensemble weight coefficients, a bias-variance framework, which is formulated by a multi-objective optimization problem, is used to assess model accuracy and stability. A novel hybrid flower pollination with bat search algorithm is proposed to search for the optimal weight coefficients based on the previous step, while Pareto optimality theory provides the necessary conditions to identify an optimal solution. In addition, data decomposition and de-noising are also incorporated into the data pre-processing stage. To evaluate the forecasting ability of the proposed model, a case study of 12 wind-speed datasets from two wind farms in the eastern coastal areas of China was completed.

SCOPUS_ID:85029590575,"Seasonal load variations in district heating systems are so large that some production units become superfluous during summer operations. There is great economic potential in shutting down these units during summer. The economic benefit of summer shutdown is highly dependent on the timing of the shutdown decision. The optimal shutdown and start-up dates depend on complex weather patterns and vary significantly from year to year. This study introduces three classes of decision rules to help production planners perform economically optimal summer shutdown: a fixed date rule, a heat load based rule and a load based rule augmented with weather forecasts. These decision rules are tested using 38years of hourly weather data to simulate the heat load in Aarhus, Denmark. The large amount of weather data allows for the creation of highly robust decision rules that account for rare, but costly weather conditions. A fixed date rule allows for planning very far ahead and can reap 90.7% of the potential economic benefit of summer shutdown. A heat load based decision rule can salvage 95.8% of the potential shutdown savings at the cost of shorter planning horizons.

This paper showcases how an Integrated Multi-scale Environmental Urban Model (IMEUM) can be employed to support planners, architects and engineers to assess the combined impacts of the UHI phenomenon and rising global temperatures due to climate change. IMEUM concept derives from downscaling environmental models from global scale (25km) to mesoscale (1km) and city scale (100m). Hence, this paper showcases a computationally efficient method which couples multi-scale atmospheric models with statistical model to estimate weather parameters. Developed under Singapore context, IMEUM can be utilized to incorporate appropriate UHI mitigation measures upfront in design process, consecutively bridging the gap between global and building scale. This paper also includes calibration of the IMEUM output using observations from ground sensors.

NILM allows to provide detailed consumption information to the users, that induces them to modify their habits towards a wiser use of the electrical energy. This paper proposes a NILM algorithm based on the joint use of active and reactive power in the Additive Factorial Hidden Markov Models framework. In particular, in the proposed approach, the appliance model is represented by a bivariate Hidden Markov Model whose emitted symbols are the joint active-reactive power signals. The disaggregation is performed by means of an alternative formulation of the Additive Factorial Approximate Maximum a Posteriori (AFAMAP) algorithm for dealing with the bivariate HMM models. The proposed solution has been compared to the original AFAMAP algorithm based on the active power only and to the seminal approach proposed by Hart (1992), based on finite state machine appliance models and which employs both the active and reactive power.

First, the confidence intervals of wind power and solar power are formulated under given confidence levels of wind speed and solar radiation, respectively. Then, the distribution probabilities of each wind power and solar power are obtained accordingly based on the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of wind speed and solar radiation, respectively. Finally, the framework of BPIO based WSP-DAS is developed to balance the profit and risk, considering a conditional expectation based optimization objective. Comparative experiments are conducted on two day-ahead scheduling systems under the dynamic uncertain wind and solar power penetration. The empirical results fully demonstrate that the proposed BPIO can significantly improve the reliability and effectiveness of evaluating WSP-DAS, in terms of obtaining a trade-off planning between profit and risk against the integration of uncertain wind-solar power.",Chen J.J.,2017-12-15,Optimal trade-off planning for wind-solar power day-ahead scheduling under uncertainties

SCOPUS_ID:85033607858,"Short-term passenger demand forecasting is of great importance to the on-demand ride service platform, which can incentivize vacant cars moving from over-supply regions to over-demand regions. The spatial dependencies, temporal dependencies, and exogenous dependencies need to be considered simultaneously, however, which makes short-term passenger demand forecasting challenging. We propose a novel deep learning (DL) approach, named the fusion convolutional long short-term memory network (FCL-Net), to address these three dependencies within one end-to-end learning architecture. The model is stacked and fused by multiple convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, standard LSTM layers, and convolutional layers. The fusion of convolutional techniques and the LSTM network enables the proposed DL approach to better capture the spatio-temporal characteristics and correlations of explanatory variables. A tailored spatially aggregated random forest is employed to rank the importance of the explanatory variables. The ranking is then used for feature selection. The proposed DL approach is applied to the short-term forecasting of passenger demand under an on-demand ride service platform in Hangzhou, China. The experimental results, validated on the real-world data provided by DiDi Chuxing, show that the FCL-Net achieves the better predictive performance than traditional approaches including both classical time-series prediction models and state-of-art machine learning algorithms (e.g., artificial neural network, XGBoost, LSTM and CNN). Furthermore, the consideration of exogenous variables in addition to the passenger demand itself, such as the travel time rate, time-of-day, day-of-week, and weather conditions, is proven to be promising, since they reduce the root mean squared error (RMSE) by 48.3%. It is also interesting to find that the feature selection reduces 24.4% in the training time and leads to only the 1.8% loss in the forecasting accuracy measured by RMSE in the proposed model. This paper is one of the first DL studies to forecast the short-term passenger demand of an on-demand ride service platform by examining the spatio-temporal correlations.",Ke J.,2017-12-01,Short-term forecasting of passenger demand under on-demand ride services: A spatio-temporal deep learning approach

The aims of the research are to evaluate the performance of different hybrid wavelet-group method of data handling (WA-GMDH) and wavelet-extreme learning machine (WA-ELM) models and to combine different wavelet based models for forecasting the GWL for one, two and three months step-ahead in the Maragheh–Bonab plain, NW Iran, as a case study. The research used totally 367 monthly GWLs (m) datasets (Sep 1985–Mar 2016) which were split into two subsets; the first 312 datasets (85% of total) were used for model development (training) and the remaining 55 ones (15% of total) for model evaluation (testing). The stepwise selection was used to select appropriate lag times as the inputs of the proposed models. The performance criteria such as coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSC) were used for assessing the efficiency of the models. The results indicated that the ELM models outperformed GMDH models. To construct the hybrid wavelet based models, the inputs and outputs were decomposed into sub-time series employing different maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) functions, namely Daubechies, Symlet, Haar and Dmeyer of different orders at level two. Subsequently, these sub-time series were served in the GMDH and ELM models as an input dataset to forecast the multi-step-ahead GWL. The wavelet based models improved the performances of GMDH and ELM models for multi-step-ahead GWL forecasting. To combine the advantages of different wavelets, a least squares boosting (LSBoost) algorithm was applied. The use of the boosting multi-WA-neural network models provided the best performances for GWL forecasts in comparison with single WA-neural network-based models.",Barzegar R.,2017-12-01,Forecasting of groundwater level fluctuations using ensemble hybrid multi-wavelet neural network-based models
SCOPUS_ID:85033433493,"The growing photovoltaic generation results in a stochastic variability of the electric demand that could compromise the stability of the grid, increase the amount of energy reserve and the energy imbalance cost. On regional scale, the estimation of the solar power generation from the real time environmental conditions and the solar power forecast is essential for Distribution System Operators, Transmission System Operator, energy traders, and Aggregators.
                  In this context, a new upscaling method was developed and used for estimation and forecast of the photovoltaic distributed generation in a small area of Italy with high photovoltaic penetration. It was based on spatial clustering of the PV fleet and neural networks models that input satellite or numerical weather prediction data (centered on cluster centroids) to estimate or predict the regional solar generation. Two different approaches were investigated. The simplest and more accurate approach requires a low computational effort and very few input information should be provided by users. The power estimation model provided a RMSE of 3% of installed capacity. Intra-day forecast (from 1 to 4 h) obtained a RMSE of 5%–7% and a skill score with respect to the smart persistence from −8% to 33.6%. The one and two days ahead forecast achieved a RMSE of 7% and 7.5% and a skill score of 39.2% and 45.7%. The smoothing effect on cluster scale was also studied. It reduces the RMSE of power estimation of 33% and the RMSE of day-ahead forecast of 12% with respect to the mean single cluster value.

SCOPUS_ID:85032018144,"Integrating photovoltaic (PV) produced electricity into the electric power system is proving to be a growing challenge due to its fluctuating nature. The combination of more rigid regulation for feed-in of PV production and steadily rising electricity prices means that battery systems are becoming more attractive to private households as a way of upping their self-consumption. At the same time, batteries make the household’s electricity purchasing strategy more complex. For these reasons, control concepts are required for PV + battery systems that ensure grid-friendly operation as well as considering the household’s primary objectives. This paper presents a forecast-based modelling approach for the operation of a battery in combination with a grid-connected PV system. PV production and electricity demand are forecasted on an hourly time-resolution using artificial neural networks (ANN). The battery charging and discharging is optimized to maximize self-consumption, and additionally a variable feed-in tariff is considered to incentivize a grid-friendly operation. The developed model was applied for a household with 3300 kWh electricity consumption equipped with a 5 kWp PV system and a 5 kWh battery. For this case, we show that the model enables a grid-friendly operation of the battery as well as an intensified usage. However, the inevitable forecasting errors lead to overall lower economic benefits for the consumer in comparison with a simple strategy that only maximizes self-consumption. Considering the inaccuracy of forecasting, we conclude that if a grid-friendly integration of PV + battery systems is to be promoted in the future, households should be provided with better forecasting data or offered other incentives to compensate their lost benefits.",Klingler A.-L.,2017-12-01,Impacts of a forecast-based operation strategy for grid-connected PV storage systems on profitability and the energy system

SCOPUS_ID:85029587154,"Air quality is closely related to quality of life. Air pollution forecasting plays a vital role in air pollution warnings and controlling. However, it is difficult to attain accurate forecasts for air pollution indexes because the original data are non-stationary and chaotic. The existing forecasting methods, such as multiple linear models, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and support vector regression (SVR), cannot fully capture the information from series of pollution indexes. Therefore, new effective techniques need to be proposed to forecast air pollution indexes. The main purpose of this research is to develop effective forecasting models for regional air quality indexes (AQI) to address the problems above and enhance forecasting accuracy. Therefore, two hybrid models (EMD-SVR-Hybrid and EMD-IMFs-Hybrid) are proposed to forecast AQI data. The main steps of the EMD-SVR-Hybrid model are as follows: the data preprocessing technique EMD (empirical mode decomposition) is utilized to sift the original AQI data to obtain one group of smoother IMFs (intrinsic mode functions) and a noise series, where the IMFs contain the important information (level, fluctuations and others) from the original AQI series. LS-SVR is applied to forecast the sum of the IMFs, and then, S-ARIMA (seasonal ARIMA) is employed to forecast the residual sequence of LS-SVR. In addition, EMD-IMFs-Hybrid first separately forecasts the IMFs via statistical models and sums the forecasting results of the IMFs as EMD-IMFs. Then, S-ARIMA is employed to forecast the residuals of EMD-IMFs. To certify the proposed hybrid model, AQI data from June 2014 to August 2015 collected from Xingtai in China are utilized as a test case to investigate the empirical research. In terms of some of the forecasting assessment measures, the AQI forecasting results of Xingtai show that the two proposed hybrid models are superior to ARIMA, SVR, GRNN, EMD-GRNN, Wavelet-GRNN and Wavelet-SVR. Therefore, the proposed hybrid models can be used as effective and simple tools for air pollution forecasting and warning as well as for management.",Zhu S.,2017-12-01,Daily air quality index forecasting with hybrid models: A case in China

SCOPUS_ID:85033725701,"The penetration of photovoltaic (PV) energy into modern electric power and energy systems has been gradually increased in recent years due to its benefits of being abundant, inexhaustible and clean. In order to reduce the negative impacts of PV energy on electric power and energy systems, advanced forecasting approach with high-accuracy is a pressing need. Aimed at this, a novel hybrid method for deterministic PV power forecasting based on wavelet transform (WT) and deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is firstly proposed in this paper. WT is used to decompose the original signal into several frequency series. Each frequency has better outlines and behaviors. DCNN is employed to extract the nonlinear features and invariant structures exhibited in each frequency. Then, a probabilistic PV power forecasting model that combines the proposed deterministic method and spine quantile regression (QR) is originally developed to statistically evaluate the probabilistic information in PV power data. The proposed deterministic and probabilistic forecasting methods are applied to real PV data series collected from PV farms in Belgium. Numerical results presented in the case studies demonstrate that the proposed methods exhibit the ability of improving forecasting accuracies in terms of seasons and various prediction horizons, when compared to conventional forecasting models.",Wang H.,2017-12-01,Deterministic and probabilistic forecasting of photovoltaic power based on deep convolutional neural network

SCOPUS_ID:85030571134,"Forecasting fuzzy time series (FTS) methods are generally divided into two categories, one is based on intervals of universal set and the other is based on clustering algorithms. Since there are some challenging problems with the interval based algorithms such as the ideal interval length, clustering based FTS algorithms are preferred. Fuzzy Logical Relationships (FLRs) are usually used to establish relationships between input and output data in both interval based and clustering based FTS algorithms. Modeling complicated systems demands high number of FLRs that incurs high runtime to train FTS algorithms. In this study, a fast and efficient clustering based fuzzy time series algorithm (FEFTS) is introduced to handle the regression, and classification problems. Superiority of FEFTS algorithm over other FTS algorithms in terms of runtime and training and testing errors is confirmed by applying the algorithm to various benchmark datasets available on the web. It is shown that FEFTS reduces testing RMSE for regression data up to 40% with the least runtime. Also, FEFTS with the same accuracy as compared to Fuzzy-Firefly classification method, diminishes runtime moderately from 324.33s to 0.0055s.",Saberi H.,2017-12-01,A fast and efficient clustering based fuzzy time series algorithm (FEFTS) for regression and classification

Due to the quality of their predictions and their efficiency, those models are considered as a suitable tool for surrogate evaluation. Despite their advantages, support vector regression models require an accurate selection of the configuration parameters in order to achieve good generalization performance. To overcome this limitation, a new hyperparameter selection method is developed. This method takes into account the training error to identify the optimal parameters set using evolutionary optimization schemes. Moreover, building on state-of-the-art techniques, an alternative analytically-assisted genetic algorithm is proposed in order to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the optimization scheme. The configuration is elaborated from a new search strategy in the design space. The results verify that the proposed technique improve the prediction accuracy and its robustness.

In this paper, a wavelet-hybrid artificial neural network (ANN) model integrated with iterative input selection (IIS) algorithm (IIS-W-ANN) is evaluated for its statistical preciseness in forecasting monthly streamflow, and it is then benchmarked against M5 Tree model. To develop hybrid IIS-W-ANN model, a global predictor matrix is constructed for three local hydrological sites (Richmond, Gwydir, and Darling River) in Australia's agricultural (Murray-Darling) Basin. Model inputs comprised of statistically significant lagged combination of streamflow water level, are supplemented by meteorological data (i.e., precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, mean solar radiation, vapor pressure and evaporation) as the potential model inputs. To establish robust forecasting models, iterative input selection (IIS) algorithm is applied to screen the best data from the predictor matrix and is integrated with the non-decimated maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) applied on the IIS-selected variables. This resolved the frequencies contained in predictor data while constructing a wavelet-hybrid (i.e., IIS-W-ANN and IIS-W-M5 Tree) model.

This paper presents a short term, intra-hour solar forecasting method. This “peer-to-peer” (P2P) forecasting method is based on the cross-correlation time lag between clear-sky index time series of pairs of PV-systems that are influenced by the (assumed) same cloud sequentially, with the feature that the forecast horizon (FH) can be set at a fixed value.

SCOPUS_ID:85032018670,"In recent years, wind power has played a significant role in energy generation of micro-grids (MGs). However, randomness nature of wind speed leading to uncertainty in wind power forecast, imposes some problems such as overestimating wind power on optimized scheduling of MG. In this paper, we propose an adaptive probabilistic concept of confidence interval (APCCI) to address these problems. The main purpose of the proposed APCCI is to modify the risk we endure to schedule wind power with other distributed energy resources (DERs) in order to degrade the unnecessary rigors and upgrade the other ones. The forecasting method which is used in this paper is artificial neural network (ANN). In order to increase the accuracy of forecasting, wavelet decomposition (WD) is applied to the wind power time series then the results are sent to ANN. After that, dependable levels for the predicted wind power based on APCCI are obtained. An energy storage system (ESS) is utilized not only to decrease the impact of forecasting errors on the MG but also to increase the flexibility of the planning. A comprehensive formulation with operational constraints is employed to model the optimization problem. An economic dispatch based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (EDNSGA-II) is proposed and applied to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. The optimization algorithm produces some alternatives which consist of different combination of objectives (cost and emission). Techniques for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is utilized to make a compromised decision between the alternatives. Eventually, the proposed algorithm is applied to a typical MG which consists of micro turbine (MT), fuel cell (FC), photo voltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT) and energy storage system (ESS). Evaluation of the results show that the proposed APCCI works well and can adapt the level of confidence interval in various situations. Moreover, the results confirm the superiority of WNN over ANN. The results also show that the proposed EDNSGA-II is more efficient in comparison with the well-known NSGA-II.",Sarshar J.,2017-11-15,Multi-objective energy management of a micro-grid considering uncertainty in wind power forecasting

Short term load forecast of such consumers has a strong potential to contribute to the improvement of the overall system efficiency. This work investigates the performance of recursive least squares for predicting the heat load of individual greenhouses in an online manner. Predictor inputs (weekly curves terms and weather forecast inputs) are selected in an automated manner using a forward selection approach. Historical load measurements from 5 Danish greenhouses with different operational characteristics were used, together with weather measurements and a weather forecast service. It was found that these predictors of reduced complexity and computational load performed well at capturing recurring load profiles, but not fast frequency random changes. Overall, the root mean square error of the prediction was within 8–20% of the peak load for the set of consumers over the 8months period considered.",Vogler-Finck P.J.C.,2017-11-01,Online short-term forecast of greenhouse heat load using a weather forecast service

Foresee is built on a multiobjective model predictive control framework, wherein the objectives consist of energy cost, thermal comfort, user convenience, and carbon emission. Foresee learns user preferences on different objectives and acts on their behalf to operate building equipment, such as home appliances, photovoltaic systems, and battery storage. In this work, machine-learning algorithms were used to derive data-driven appliance models and usage patterns to predict the home’s future energy consumption. This approach enables highly accurate predictions of comfort needs, energy costs, environmental impacts, and grid service availability. Simulation studies were performed on field data from a residential building stock data set collected in the Pacific Northwest. Results indicated that foresee generated up to 7.6% whole-home energy savings without requiring substantial behavioral changes. When responding to demand response events, foresee was able to provide load forecasts upon receipt of event notifications and delivered the committed demand response services with 10% or fewer errors. Foresee fully utilized the potential of the battery storage and controllable building loads and delivered up to 7.0-kW load reduction and 13.5-kW load increase.

In case of high-end priced products, the demand is seasonal and sensitive. The investment involves high risk and revenues vary beyond fathomable bounds. The primary objective of this research is to present a decision-support system for retail pricing and revenue optimization of these retail products. The sales data of past 2.5years from prominent retail stores across 45 different regions has been used to develop this study. A regression tree/random forest-based machine learning algorithm is used to predict weekly demand. It incorporates price, holidays, discounts, inventory and other regional factors in decision making. Following this, the demand-price interdependencies are quantified and integrated into an integer linear programming model for optimal price allocation. This methodology has been implemented on offline retailing of expensive products which generally follow high variation in demand. The expected revenue has been optimized by branch & bound and branch & cut method, followed by root node analysis.

Meanwhile, big data has revolutionized the transportation industry over the past several years. These two hot topics have inspired us to reconsider the traditional issue of passenger flow prediction. Asa special structure of deep neural network (DNN), an autoencoder can deeply and abstractly extract the nonlinear features embedded in the input without any labels. By exploiting its remarkable capabilities, a novel hourly passenger flow prediction model using deep learning methods is proposed in this paper. Temporal features including the day of a week, the hour of a day, and holidays, the scenario features including inbound and outbound, and tickets and cards, and the passenger flow features including the previous average passenger flow and real-time passenger flow, are defined as the input features. These features are combined and trained as different stacked autoencoders (SAE) in the first stage. Then, the pre-trained SAE are further used to initialize the supervised DNN with the real-time passenger flow as the label data in the second stage. The hybrid model (SAE-DNN) is applied and evaluated with a case study of passenger flow prediction for four bus rapid transit (BRT) stations of Xiamen in the third stage. The experimental results show that the proposed method has the capability to provide a more accurate and universal passenger flow prediction model for different BRT stations with different passenger flow profiles.",Liu L.,2017-11-01,A novel passenger flow prediction model using deep learning methods

SCOPUS_ID:85027888921,"Electricity forecasting is an essential component of smart grid, which has attracted increasing academic interest. Forecasting enables informed and efficient responses for electricity demand. However, various forecasting models exist making it difficult for inexperienced researchers to make an informed model selection. This paper presents a systematic review of forecasting models with the main purpose of identifying which model is best suited for a particular case or scenario. Over 113 different case studies reported across 41 academic papers have been used for the comparison. The timeframe, inputs, outputs, scale, data sample size, error type and value have been taken into account as criteria for the comparison. The review reveals that despite the relative simplicity of all reviewed models, the regression and/or multiple regression are still widely used and efficient for long and very long-term prediction. For short and very short-term prediction, machine-learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and time series analysis (including Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and the Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA)) are favoured. The most widely employed independent variables are the building and occupancy characteristics and environmental data, especially in the machine learning models. In many cases, time series analysis and regressions rely on electricity historical data only, without the introduction of exogenous variables. Overall, if the singularity of the different cases made the comparison difficult, some trends are clearly identifiable. Considering the large amount of use cases studied, the meta-analysis of the references led to the identification of best practices within the expert community in relation to forecasting use for electricity consumption and power load prediction. Therefore, from the findings of the meta-analysis, a taxonomy has been defined in order to help researchers make an informed decision and choose the right model for their problem (long or short term, low or high resolution, building to country level).",Kuster C.,2017-11-01,Electrical load forecasting models: A critical systematic review

Traditionally, the fitness function of these search heuristics is based on an accuracy measure. In this paper, however, we combine forecasting accuracy with business expertise by defining a flexible and easily interpretable profit function for sales forecasting, which is based on the profit margin of a given product, the volume of its sales and the accuracy of the forecast. ProfARIMA is a new procedure that selects the lags of a Seasonal ARIMA model according to the profit of a model's forecasts by taking advantage of search heuristics. This procedure is tested on both publicly available datasets and a real-life application with datasets of The Coca-Cola Company in order to assess its performance, both in profit and accuracy. Three different evolutionary algorithms were implemented during this testing process, i.e. Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization and Simulated Annealing. The results indicate that ProfARIMA always performs at least equally to the Box–Jenkins methodology and often outperforms this traditional procedure.

SCOPUS_ID:85028991271,"Measurement and Verification (M&V) is often required for energy efficiency or demand side management projects in buildings, to demonstrate that savings were in fact achieved. For projects where sampling has to be done, these costs can be the most significant driver of the overall M&V project cost, especially in multi-year (longitudinal) projects. This study presents a method for calculating efficient combined metering and survey sample designs for longitudinal M&V of retrofit projects. In this paper, a building lighting retrofit case study is considered. A Dynamic Linear Model (DLM) with Bayesian forecasting is used. The Bayesian component of the model determines the sample size-weighted uncertainty bounds on multi-year metering studies, with results from previous years incorporated into the overall calculation to reduce forecast uncertainty. The DLM is compared to previous meter sampling methods, and an investigation into the robustness of efficient sampling plans is also conducted. The Mellin Transform Moment Calculation method is then used to combine the DLM with a Dynamic Generalised Linear Model describing the uncertainty in survey results for the longitudinal monitoring of lamp population decay. A genetic algorithm is employed to optimise the combined sampling design. Besides the reliable uncertainty quantification features of the method, results show a reduction in sampling costs of 40% for simple random sampling, and approximately 26.6% for stratified sampling, as compared to realistic benchmark methods.",Carstens H.,2017-11-01,Efficient metering and surveying sampling designs in longitudinal Measurement and Verification for lighting retrofit

SCOPUS_ID:85029808635,"Over the past few decades, a large literature has evolved to forecast time series using various linear, nonlinear and hybrid linear–nonlinear models. Recently, hybrid models by suitably combining linear models like autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) with nonlinear models like artificial neural network (ANN) have become popular due to superior performance than individual models. These models assume the time series to be a sum of a linear and a nonlinear component. However, a real world time series may be purely linear or purely nonlinear or often contains a combination of linear and nonlinear patterns. Motivated by this need, a new hybrid methodology is developed by combining linear and nonlinear exponential smoothing models from innovation state space (ETS) with ANN. The proposed hybrid ETS–ANN model glorifies the chances of capturing different combination of linear and/or nonlinear patterns in time series. This is because both ETS and ANN models have linear as well as nonlinear modeling capability. However, ANN cannot handle linear patterns equally well as nonlinear patterns. Therefore, in the proposed method, first ETS is applied to the given time series and predictions are obtained. This enhances the chances of capturing existing linear patterns (if any) well using linear ETS models. Then residual error sequence is calculated by subtracting the ETS-predictions from the original series. The residual error sequence obtained is modeled by ANN. Then final prediction is obtained by combining the ETS-predictions with ANN-predictions. Sixteen time series datasets are used for comparative performance analysis of the proposed methodology with ARIMA, ETS, multilayer perceptron(MLP) and some existing hybrid ARIMA–ANN models. Experimental results show that the proposed hybrid model shows statistically promising result for the datasets used.",Panigrahi S.,2017-11-01,A hybrid ETS–ANN model for time series forecasting

In this paper, we present a methodology to extract and validate rules (and patterns) as time bound failure signatures for real time failure predictions, using Bayesian approach. In comparison to existing approaches to learn and extract failure signatures, the presented methodology offers extraction, selection and validation of rules/patterns which is linked to sufficient time to execute corrective and proactive measures to avoid failures (the time bound). Moreover, proposed methodology uses event driven contextual information from product, process, equipment and maintenance data sources, instead of relying only on sensor data. This is to avoid sensor biases, as decision support equipment/module levels and the fact that failure source is not necessarily the equipment which could result in over engineering.

The proposed method is a novel combination of the ANFIS model with the firefly algorithm asan optimizer tool to construct a hybrid ANFIS-FFA model. The results of the ANFIS-FFA model is compared with the classical ANFIS model, which utilizes the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering method in the Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS) generation. The historical monthly streamflow data for Pahang River, which is a major river system in Malaysia that characterized by highly stochastic hydrological patterns, is used in the study. Sixteen different input combinations with one to five time-lagged input variables are incorporated into the ANFIS-FFA and ANFIS models to consider the antecedent seasonal variations in historical streamflow data.

The house features an under floor heating system, fed by an air-source heat pump. Based on forecast air temperatures and solar radiation levels, the controller firstly predicts the following day’s heating requirements to achieve thermal comfort; secondly, it runs the heat pump during off peak periods to deliver the required heat by pre-charging the under floor heating. Prior to its installation in the building, the controller’s operating characteristics were identified using a calibrated building simulation model. The performance of the controller in the house was monitored over four weeks in 2015. The monitored data indicated that the actual thermal performance of the predictive controller was better than that projected using simulation, with better levels of thermal comfort achieved. Indoor air temperatures were between 18°C and 23°C for around 87% of the time between 07:00 and 22:00. However, the performance of the heat pump under load shift control was extremely poor, with the heat being delivered primarily by the unit’s auxiliary immersion coil. The paper concludes with a refined version of the controller, that should improve the day-ahead energy predictions and offer greater flexibility in heat pump operation for future field trials.",Allison J.,2017-10-15,"Simulation, implementation and monitoring of heat pump load shifting using a predictive controller"

A prevalent application of DI in irrigated agriculture represents a serious option to preserve scarce water resources. The water savings in DI result from plant internal dynamic processes leading to more efficient water use. Therefore it is assumed that irrigation can be controlled at the state/point of time of optimal plant water use, if irrigation methods comprise models for dynamical plant behavior. Overall target of this contribution is to provide an overview about the state-of-the-art in modeling irrigation approaches used for DI. The mapping of DI considerations by integration of models for dynamic plant behavior in irrigation methods, and consequently in ecological considerations of land use und fresh water balance is particularly considered. In this contribution, based on a comprehensive literature review soil-, plant-, and atmosphere-based irrigation approaches are comparatively described. The related conversion of system output variables into irrigation variables is depicted in a causality mapping overview. The presented descriptions are consistently structured according to system-theoretical taxonomy making them accessible to various control aspects. It can be stated that none of the presented irrigation approaches and crop models by itself provides all relevant variables necessary to realize irrigation based on the actual crop water demand for deficit irrigation purposes. This indicates starting points for further research to align irrigation to DI requirements and to improve efficiency of water use in agriculture. The consideration of dynamical behavior of crops in ecological models on larger scale could further improve simulation results and predictions regarding the sustainability of agricultural fresh water consumption and water balance. The review is structured as follows: After a short introduction (Section 1), basic crop water status and stress terms are briefly presented in Section 2. Then, the object of investigation is specified (Section 3). In the main Section 4 a short introduction to system theory is given specified by correspondingly detailed descriptions and causality mapping of each system identified: Soil system (Section 4.1), plant system (Section 4.2), and atmosphere system (Section 4.3). Summarizing, comparative remarks (Section 5) and a tabulated overview about the major system-theoretical characteristics of the presented irrigation approaches (Section 6) are given.",Kogler F.,2017-10-10,Water (stress) models and deficit irrigation: System-theoretical description and causality mapping

SCOPUS_ID:85017543687,"A well-performed demand forecasting can provide outpatient department (OPD) managers with essential information for staff scheduling and rostering, considering the non-reservation policy of OPD in China. Based on the results reported by relevant studies, most approaches have focused on forecasting the overall amount of patient flow and ignored the demand for other key resources in OPD or similar department. Moreover, few studies have conducted feature selection before training a forecast model, which is a significant pre-processing operation of data mining and widely applied for knowledge discovery in expert and intelligent system. This study develops a novel hybrid methodology to forecast the patients’ demand for different key resources in OPD, by combining a new feature selection method and a deep learning approach. A modified version of genetic algorithm (MGA) is proposed for feature selection. The key operators of normal genetic algorithm are redesigned to utilize useful information provided by filter-based feature selection and feature combinations. A feedforward deep neural network is introduced as the forecast model, and the initial parameter set is generated from a stacked autoencoder-based pre-training process to overcome the optimization challenges in constructing deep architectures. In order to evaluate the performance of our methodology, it is applied to an OPD located at Northeast China. The results are compared with those obtained from combinations of other feature selection methods and demand forecasting models. Compared with GA and PCA, MGA improves the quality and efficiency of feature selection, with less selected features to get higher forecast accuracy. Pre-trained DNN optimally strengthens the advantage of MGA, compared with MLR, ARIMAX and SANN. The combination of MGA and pre-trained DNN possesses strongest predictive power among all involved combinations. Furthermore, the results of proposed methodology are crucial prerequisites for staff scheduling and resource allocation in OPD. Elite features obtained by MGA can provide practical insights on potential association between manifold feature combinations and demand variance.",Jiang S.,2017-10-01,Modified genetic algorithm-based feature selection combined with pre-trained deep neural network for demand forecasting in outpatient department

First of all, AECs are disassembled from WPCBs by a self-designed machine; meanwhile, the disassembled AECs are subjected to an integrated process, involving heating treatment, crushing, sieving, and magnetic separating, to recover aluminum and iron; finally, the off-gas and residue generated during the aforementioned processes are analyzed to evaluate environmental risks. The results indicate that 96.52% and 98.68% of aluminum and iron, respectively, can be recovered from AECs under the optimal condition. The off-gas generated during the process is mainly composed of elements of C, H, and O, indicating that the off-gas is non-toxic and could be re-utilized as clean energy source. The residue according with toxicity characteristics leaching standard can be landfilled safely in sanitary landfill site.

An empirical study is performed to explore the contributions of different degrees of freedom in the modeling process to the forecast accuracy. First, a comparative analysis of alternative prediction methods provides evidence that random forest regression is particularly effective for resale price forecasting. It is also shown that the use of linear regression, the prevailing method in previous work, should be avoided. Second, the empirical results demonstrate the presence of heterogeneity in resale price forecasting and identify methods that can automatically overcome its detrimental effect on the forecast accuracy. Finally, the study confirms that the sellers of used cars possess informational advantages over market research agencies, which enable them to forecast resale prices more accurately.

SCOPUS_ID:85029952872,"The application of machine learning to agriculture is currently experiencing a “surge of interest” from the academic community as well as practitioners from industry. This increased attention has produced a number of differing approaches that use varying machine learning frameworks. It is arguable that Bayesian Networks are particularly suited to agricultural research due to their ability to reason with incomplete information and incorporate new information. Bayesian Networks are currently underrepresented in the machine learning applied to agriculture research literature, and to date there are no survey papers that currently centralize the state of the art. The aim of this paper is rectify the lack of a survey paper in this area by providing a self-contained resource that will: centralize the current state of the art, document the historical progression of Bayesian Networks in agriculture and indicate possible future lines of research as well as providing an introduction to Bayesian Networks for researchers who are new to the area.",Drury B.,2017-10-01,A survey of the applications of Bayesian networks in agriculture

Monthly stream flow records used in this prediction problem comprise two stations at Bear River, the U.S.A., for the period of 1961–2012. Six different model structures are investigated for both MLP-LM and MLP-FFA models and their results were analysed using a number of performance measures including Correlation Coefficients (CC) and the Taylor diagram. The results indicate a significant improvement is likely in predicting downstream flows by MLP-FFA over that by MLP-LM, attributed to identifying the global minimum. In addition, an emerging multiple model (ensemble) strategy is employed to treat the outputs of the two MLP-LM and MLP-FFA models as inputs to an ANN model. The results show yet another further possible improvement.

Our results show that measures of the short-term interest rate and the term spread are important leading indicators. The recession probability is a nonlinear function of these leading indicators. The BRT approach also helps to uncover the way in which the recession probability depends on the interactions between the leading indicators. While the predictive power of the short-term interest rates has declined over time, the term spread and the stock market have gained in importance.

The current study undertakes an analysis of 308 home energy management (HEM) products to identify key differences in terms of functionality and quality. Findings identified opportunities for energy savings (both behavioural and operational) as well as load shifting across most product categories, however, in many instances other potential benefits related to convenience, comfort, or security may limit the realisation of savings. This is due to lack of information related to energy being collected and presented to users, as well as lack of understanding of how users may interact with the additional information and control provided. While the current study goes some way to identify the technical capabilities and potential for HEM products to deliver savings, it is recommended that further work expand on this to identify how users interact with these technologies in their home, in both a standalone and fully integrated smart home environment to deliver benefits to both homes and the grid.",Ford R.,2017-10-01,Categories and functionality of smart home technology for energy management

Three main efforts have been made to distinguish our work from exiting research. Firstly, a hierarchical driving behavior model is constructed, providing in-depth knowledge about behavior generation, transmission, and consequence. Secondly, an online driving behavior classification method is designed. The proposed method is the coefficient result of offline driving behavior study based on self-report driving behavior questionnaire (DBQ) and online driving behavior discrimination by BP neural network. Thirdly, an improved adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (IA-ECMS) is formulated based on identified driving behavior and predicted real time traffic information.

SCOPUS_ID:85035105142,"Time series forecasting is of fundamental importance in big data analysis. The prediction of noisy, non-stationary, and chaotic time series demands good generalization from small amounts of data. Vapnik showed that the total risk is dependent on both, empirical error as well as model complexity, where the latter may be measured in terms of the Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. In other words, good generalization requires minimizing model complexity. The recently proposed Minimal Complexity Machine (MCM) has been shown to minimize a tight bound on the VC dimension, and has further been extended to Minimal Complexity Machine Regression (MCMR). In this paper, we present an original approach based on the MCM regressor, which builds sparse and accurate models for short-term time series forecasting. Results on a number of datasets establish that the proposed approach is superior to a number of state-of-the-art methods, and yields sparse models. These sparse models are able to extract only the most important information present in the data sets, thereby achieving high accuracy. Sparsity in time series forecasting models is also important in reducing the evaluation time.

Policy, technology and human awareness provide opportunities for offsetting these effects through energy conservation, efficient appliances and solar generation in households as these have been the subject of increasing attention across the world in recent years. Solar rooftop generation, in particular, could deliver significant efficiency improvements and reductions of CO2 emissions through its diffusion, which also avoids losses in electricity transmission and distribution systems; energy efficiency contributes to the achievement of a sustainable future because it reduces the energy-infrastructure needs, increases competitiveness and improves consumer welfare; conservation would also reduce CO2 emissions in households. The purpose of this paper is to assess the combined effect of the diffusion of solar rooftop generation, energy efficiency and electricity conservation in the residential sector in Colombia. Simulation results for different policy scenarios indicate that rooftop generation, energy efficiency and conservation can together lead, under certain conditions, to important reductions in both electricity prices and emissions.",Cardenas L.,2017-09-20,"Assessing the combined effect of the diffusion of solar rooftop generation, energy conservation and efficient appliances in households"

SCOPUS_ID:85021714468,"In line with the decomposition-and-reconstitution principle, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based modeling framework has been a widely used alternative for non-linear, non-stationary time series prediction to decompose an original time series into different sub-series that can be identified, separately predicted, and then recombined for aggregate forecasting. However, in many cases, recombination has been found to adversely affect prediction accuracy. To address this problem, this study incorporates a feed forward neural network (FNN) into the EMD-based forecasting framework and brings forward the weighted recombination strategy to allow for one step ahead forward prediction. To justify and compare the effectiveness of the proposed model, four non-linear, non-stationary data series are applied and benchmarked using four well-established prediction model recombination methods. The results show that the proposed weighted EMD-based forecasting model observably improves forecast validity.

SCOPUS_ID:85021396742,"Accurate modelling and prediction of energy consumption of the air conditioning system is crucial for improving decision making. A method for predicting the energy consumption of air-conditioning systems is proposed in this paper. Based on the same weather type (sunny, cloudy, overcast, or rainy) and day type (workdays or holidays), the similarity errors using the combined weight method and the baseline errors of similar working conditions are calculated with this method. These conditions include outdoor temperature and lighting and plug power, then, similar days are determined within a certain similar error range. In addition, the air-conditioning energy consumption in these similar days is regarded as that in the predicted days. The similarity errors in selecting similar days are acquired by efficiently combining subjective weights, objective entropy weights, and correlation coefficients. To verify the accuracies of the predicted energy consumption using similar days method based on combined weights, a simulation was performed by eQUEST. According to the simulation example of measured data in an office building, it is proved that the proposed prediction method with high forecast accuracy can select similar days with a high degree of similarity under non-catastrophic weather conditions, and offer promise for wider engineering application.",Ma Z.,2017-09-15,Energy consumption prediction of air-conditioning systems in buildings by selecting similar days based on combined weights
SCOPUS_ID:85021983734,"The heating energy demand stated in energy performance certificates (EPC) and in other instruments used in the of evaluation of building’s energy performance is usually determined assuming very specific (reference) indoor behavioral/heating patterns. Particularly, they tend to assume that households heat (nearly) the entire house to a “comfort” temperature during (nearly) all the heating season. However, several field studies have shown that there are major niches of the housing stock which do not follow this pattern (even the majority, in some geographical areas). Considering this matter, it would be interesting to build models able to estimate heating energy use values resultant from occupation and heating patterns different from those considered as “reference”.
                  This work aimed at producing tools to assess the relationship between heating energy use and indoor temperatures at different levels of occupant behavior (in terms of where, when and at what temperature households heat their dwellings). This relationship was expressed through models while still takes advantage of the information from the certificates.
                  The work developed artificial neural networks (ANN) that characterize the relationship between heating energy use, indoor temperatures and the heating energy demand under reference conditions (typically available from energy rating/certificates) in the residential buildings, for different occupant behaviors/heating patterns. Theoretically, these models can be applicable to any national geographical context.
                  The data for building the ANNs was obtained from dynamic thermal building simulations using ESP-r, considering a large number of housing types and hypothetical occupation and heating patterns (i.e., which parts of the house are heated, when and at what temperature). From the analysis performed, it was possible to conclude that the developed ANN models proved to perform well (R2
                     >0.93) in estimating either heating energy use or indoor temperature, both at an individual and at the building stock level.

SCOPUS_ID:85030176658,"Three-dimensional hydrogel constructs incorporated with live stem cells that support chondrogenic differentiation and maintenance offer a promising regenerative route towards addressing the limited self-repair capabilities of articular cartilage. In particular, hydrogel scaffolds that augment chondrogenesis and recapitulate the native physical properties of cartilage, such as compressive strength, can potentially be applied in point-of-care procedures. We report here the synthesis of two new materials, [poly-l-lactic acid/polyethylene glycol/poly-l-lactic acid] (PLLA-PEG 1000) and [poly-d,l-lactic acid/polyethylene glycol/poly-d,l-lactic acid] (PDLLA-PEG 1000), that are biodegradable, biocompatible (>80% viability post fabrication), and possess high, physiologically relevant mechanical strength (∼1500 to 1800kPa). This study examined the effects of physiologically relevant cell densities (4, 8, 20, and 50×106/mL) and hydrogel stiffnesses (∼150kPa to∼1500kPa Young’s moduli) on chondrogenesis of human bone marrow stem cells incorporated in hydrogel constructs fabricated with these materials and a previously characterized PDLLA-PEG 4000. Results showed that 20×106
                     cells/mL, under a static culture condition, was the most efficient cell seeding density for extracellular matrix (ECM) production on the basis of hydroxyproline and glycosaminoglycan content. Interestingly, material stiffness did not significantly affect chondrogenesis, but rather material concentration was correlated to chondrogenesis with increasing levels at lower concentrations based on ECM production, chondrogenic gene expression, and histological analysis. These findings establish optimal cell densities for chondrogenesis within three-dimensional cell-incorporated hydrogels, inform hydrogel material development for cartilage tissue engineering, and demonstrate the efficacy and potential utility of PDLLA-PEG 1000 for point-of-care treatment of cartilage defects.

SCOPUS_ID:85019543730,"We present a method of forecasting 24-h power load profile in state-wide power system in Poland. The presented method is based on a hybrid artificial intelligence system. It employs actual temperature forecasts prepared by Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modelling of Warsaw University. The machine learning part of the system consists of 24 instances of Hierarchical Estimator: a machine learning method that divides the problem into non-exclusive subproblems with the help of fuzzy clustering and combines results of fairly simple neural networks trained on those subproblems into one, possibly more accurate solution. The presented system also includes a part responsible for dealing with days that have distinct power load patterns, such as additional state holidays. That latter part uses 30 (or 33) appropriately arranged linear regressions.
                  The proposed approach was tested on historical load data from Poland and a few other countries. The achieved MAPE varied from 1.08% to 2.26% in dependence on the country. Such errors are among the lowest achieved by the published methods.",Brodowski S.,2017-09-01,A hybrid system for forecasting 24-h power load profile for Polish electric grid
SCOPUS_ID:85020035518,"An innovative short term wind power prediction system is proposed which exploits the learning ability of deep neural network based ensemble technique and the concept of transfer learning. In the proposed DNN-MRT scheme, deep auto-encoders act as base-regressors, whereas Deep Belief Network is used as a meta-regressor. Employing the concept of ensemble learning facilitates robust and collective decision on test data, whereas deep base and meta-regressors ultimately enhance the performance of the proposed DNN-MRT approach. The concept of transfer learning not only saves time required during training of a base-regressor on each individual wind farm dataset from scratch but also stipulates good weight initialization points for each of the wind farm for training. The effectiveness of the proposed, DNN-MRT technique is expressed by comparing statistical performance measures in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and standard deviation error (SDE) with other existing techniques.",Qureshi A.S.,2017-09-01,Wind power prediction using deep neural network based meta regression and transfer learning

SCOPUS_ID:85011545474,"It is estimated that Europe alone will need to add over 250,000km of transmission capacity by 2050, if it is to meet renewable energy production goals while maintaining security of supply. Estimating the cost of new transmission infrastructure is difficult, but it is crucial to predict these costs as accurately as possible, given their importance to the energy transition. Transmission capacity expansion plans are often founded on optimistic projections of expansion costs. We present probabilistic predictive models of the cost of submarine power cables, which can be used by policymakers, industry, and academia to better approximate the true cost of transmission expansion plans. The models are both generalizable and well-specified for a variety of submarine applications, across a variety of regions. The best performing statistical learning model has slightly more predictive power than a simpler, linear econometric model. The specific decision context will determine whether the extra data gathering effort for the statistical learning model is worth the additional precision. A case study illustrates that incorporating the uncertainty associated with the cost prediction to calculate risk metrics - value-at-risk and conditional-value-at-risk - provides useful information to the decision-maker about cost variability and extremes.",Schell K.R.,2017-09-01,Probabilistic cost prediction for submarine power cable projects
SCOPUS_ID:85019769810,"Short-term passenger flow forecasting is one of the crucial components in transportation systems with data support for transportation planning and management. For forecasting bus passenger flow, this paper proposes a multi-pattern deep fusion (MPDF) approach that is constructed by fusing deep belief networks (DBNs) corresponding to multiple patterns. The dataset of the short-term bus passenger flow is first segmented into different clusters by an affinity propagation algorithm. The passenger flow distribution of these clusters is subsequently analyzed for identifying different patterns. In each pattern, a DBN is developed as a deep representation for the passenger flow. The outputs of the DBNs are finally fused by chronological order rearrangement. Taking a bus line in Guangzhou city of China as an example, the present MPDF approach is modeled. Five approaches, non-parametric and parametric models, are applied to the same case for comparison. The results show that, the proposed model overwhelms all the peer methods in terms of mean absolute percentage error, root-mean-square error, and determination coefficient criteria. In addition, there exists significant difference between the addressed model and the comparison models. It is recommended from the present study that the deep learning technique incorporating the pattern analysis is promising in forecasting the short-term passenger flow.",Bai Y.,2017-09-01,A multi-pattern deep fusion model for short-term bus passenger flow forecasting
SCOPUS_ID:85013665232,"Air-quality forecasting is difficult because air quality time series are heterogeneous, consisting of one-dimension series data and multi-dimension panel data. Therefore, a hybrid forecasting model with both linear and nonlinear models may be appropriate to represent the complex behavior of a heterogeneous time series data set. In this paper, a new hybrid-Garch (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) methodology is proposed in order to integrate the individual forecasting models of the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and SVM(Support Vector Machine). The hybrid-Garch approach for time series prediction is tested by 10-day hourly PM2.5 concentrations data including linear and non-linear, in Shenzhen, China. Empirical results from six station data sets indicate that: 1) the PM2.5 concentrations of Shenzhen experiences a regular fluctuation during the 24 h of the whole day with the peak value in working hours due to factory and vehicle emissions. 2) Spatial difference of PM2.5 concentrations is not noticeable because of the geographical and meteorological conditions. 3) The proposed hybrid model generates a more reliable and accurate forecast capability. 4) The proposed hybrid model analyses the time series data with possibly conditional heteroscedasticity characteristics and estimates the variance for the volatility of the PM2.5 concentrations.",Wang P.,2017-09-01,A novel hybrid-Garch model based on ARIMA and SVM for PM2.5 concentrations forecasting

The main objective was to evaluate the capability of fractal algorithms (Classical Fractal algorithm, CFA; Fractal Texture Algorithm, FTA and One Point Fractal Texture Algorithm, OPFTA) to analyse MRI in order to predict quality parameters of loin. In addition, the effect of the sequence acquisition of MRI (Gradient echo, GE; Spin echo, SE and Turbo 3D, T3D) and the predictive technique of data mining (Isotonic regression, IR and Multiple linear regression, MLR) were analysed. Both fractal algorithm, FTA and OPFTA are appropriate to analyse MRI of loins. The sequence acquisition, the fractal algorithm and the data mining technique seems to influence on the prediction results. For most physico-chemical parameters, prediction equations with moderate to excellent correlation coefficients were achieved by using the following combinations of acquisition sequences of MRI, fractal algorithms and data mining techniques: SE-FTA-MLR, SE-OPFTA-IR, GE-OPFTA-MLR, SE-OPFTA-MLR, with the last one offering the best prediction results.

Hence, it is further tested, in the framework of a multivariate spectrum analysis, the case of energy consumption synchronization between Europe and, respectively, United States and Japan for a time span between 1981 and 2011 based on the data provided by U.S. Energy Information Administration.

SCOPUS_ID:85024098913,"The use of low cost cameras has been extended in all fields of technology in general, and agricultural applications in particular. Images provide useful information on the growing state of horticultural crops, which allow an accurate estimation of water balance and, hence, precise irrigation scheduling. In all of these cases, the temporary images of a crop can provide the percentage of green cover (PCG). This data is calibrated with the irrigation water amount that the crop needs for growing. Therefore, the use of visual monitoring systems in agriculture may reduce water consumption and increase productivity. In this paper, a novel system is presented using low cost cameras and a client-server architecture. It is composed of a set of inexpensive camera modules which communicate with a cloud computing server. Camera modules have been developed using open standard Arduino components; they are able to work independently, with their own connectivity, storage and power supply. On the other hand, the server is responsible for configuring these modules, performing computer vision algorithms and water balance estimation, storing all data in a secure database, and interacting with the user interface using the web. The final result is a complete and inexpensive system that allows continuous monitoring of the state of the crops, providing the user with valuable information about water balance for irrigation management. The proposed method achieves a high accuracy in the estimation of PGC, with an average error below 5%, requiring less than 2s of processing time per image in the server. This is transformed into an error in the computation of the crop coefficient below 1%. Technical details on the hardware and software components of the system are presented. Finally, advantages and weaknesses of the proposed solution are discussed, drawing new lines for future research.",Gonzalez-Esquiva J.M.,2017-09-01,Development of a visual monitoring system for water balance estimation of horticultural crops using low cost cameras

Having an OS that is compatible with Iranian security applications and requirements is imperative. The first attempt to create local operating system in Iran was made some 10years ago, when pertinent technological research led to the development of Xamin as Iran's localized operating system. When the first version of the Xamin localized operating system was introduced in the market, some 250 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as 5 large organizations adopted the national operating system. This study analyzes the process of acceptance of Xamin localized open source server operating system technology in Iran. A technology acceptance model (TAM) has been used as the base model, and external variables have been determined based on surveying method. Moreover, two moderator variables have been introduced as new contributors in this study. The results are extracted using path analysis based on structural equation modeling. The statistical population is 250 Xamin users. Data collection tools consist of 200 questionnaires filled out by these users. The results show that subjective norm component and absorptive capacity moderator are two factors affecting the acceptance of this technology.

SCOPUS_ID:85030566441,"The objective of the study was to determine the impact of urban growth on future micro-climate of Harare by predicting future distribution of land use and land cover, as well as land surface temperature using Cellular Automata Markov Chain analysis. Landsat series data was used to map Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) and land surface temperature distribution during the month of October for the year 1984, 1993, 2001 and 2015. The Cellular Automata Markov Chain analysis was used to determine long term landscape transformation at 10-year time steps from 2015 to 2045. We further tested the potential of a variety of vegetation and non-vegetation indices to predict land surface temperature. Results show that the Urban Index (UI), non-vegetation index was the best predictor of surface temperature, since it had the highest correlation with retrieved surface temperature (r = 0.9831). When tested against temperature derived from thermal band in October 2015, the mean absolute percentage error of the UI derived temperature was 5.27%. Based on changes which occurred between 1984 and 2015, the Cellular Automata Markov Chain analysis predicted that high density built-up areas will increase monotonically from 470.02 in 2015 to 490.36 km2 in 2045. Green spaces were predicted as decreasing from 57.42 to 27.85 km2, while croplands also decrease from 30.27 to 16.93 km2 between 2015 and 2040. Using UI as predictor of land surface temperature, we predicted that the 18–28 °C class will decrease in coverage between 2015 and 2040, while the 36–45 °C category will increase in proportion covered from 42.5 to 58% of city. We concluded that continued urban growth will increase warming and result in high future temperatures unless mitigation efforts are strengthened.

Developing an appropriate algorithm to predict occupancy presence will allow a better control and optimization of the whole building energy consumption. However, most previous studies of development of such model only focus on commercial buildings. The occupancy model of residential houses are usually based on Time User Survey data. This study focuses on providing a unique data set of four residential houses collected from occupancy sensors. A new inhomogeneous Markov model for occupancy presence prediction is proposed and compared to commonly used models such as Probability Sampling, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Regression. Training periods for the presence prediction are optimized based on change-point analysis of historical data. The study further explores and evaluates the predictive capability of the models by various temporal scenarios, including 15-min ahead, 30-min ahead, 1-hour ahead, and 24-hour ahead forecasts. The spatial-level comparison is additionally conducted by evaluating the prediction accuracy at both room-level and house-level. The final results show that the proposed Markov model outperforms the other methods in terms of an average 5% correctness with 11% maximum difference in 15-min ahead forecast of the occupancy presence.

SCOPUS_ID:85019350695,"This paper first defines the concept of energy-driven urban design. It aims to reveal synergies and trade-offs that may arise while designing urban areas for better energy performance. To facilitate urban planners and designers tackle these problems at the early stage of their work, this paper proposes the idea of simulation-based urban form generation and optimization modeling. It connects parametric models of urban form generation to an optimization engine coupled with a widely available program of energy systems.
                  To build up the model of simulation-based urban form generation and optimization modeling, this paper reviews the state-of-the-art of simulation-based design generation and optimization modeling and discusses its application on energy-driven urban design at the district scale. The paper compares the main generative methods and presents their limitations and advantages to aid energy-driven urban design. For the urban form generation modeling, the paper also reviews the most relevant approaches to urban morphology. These approaches help to define the urban elements for the urban form generation.
                  Most of the existing design generation and optimization models are observed to consist of a workflow, a generative method, and a series of generation constraints. Based on this, the paper proposes a model of simulation-based urban form generation and optimization modeling for energy-driven urban design.

Thus most of the conventional approaches currently employed for the modeling and forecasting involve great complexity and uncertainty. Recently, fluctuation characteristic analysis has increasingly become essential step in the application of electricity demand forecasting, yet the implementation of this analysis is an inherently difficult task. To obtain reasonable accuracy and stability in the modeling, there has been the tendency to accommodate multidimensional attributes of the consumption demands with decomposition based approach in terms of more advanced and hybrid form. And the decomposition can be achieved through utilization of two different procedures, namely component model-based and frequency domain analysis-based decomposition. Consequently, a comprehensive review and summarization of decomposition based approach for the prediction is conducted in this paper.

SCOPUS_ID:85019599286,"The global warming is a major concern in the present era that arises a need of cleaner production of energy. The wind energy is a major source of contribution for such clean energy demands. The Wind farm layout optimization (WFLO) problem deals with the optimum placement of wind turbines in a wind farm so as to maximize the total power output with minimum cost of energy. The placement of turbines is crucial for a wind farm because the power generation of wind turbine decreases if it is in the wake effect produced by the upstream turbines. So, WFLO problem is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem for which many direct search and local optimization method fails to attend the global optimum solution. The Meta-heuristic method often provides the effective solution for such problems in terms of convergence and the quality of the solution. In this work two, different metaheuristics algorithms are proposed to solve WFLO problem. These algorithms are developed by incorporating changes in the basic Teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO) algorithm. The proposed algorithms eliminate the limitations of basic TLBO algorithm to enhance its exploration and exploitation by incorporating effective search techniques. The implementations of the proposed algorithm are effective to optimize the position of wind turbines in a wind farm to maximize the expected power output of a wind farm with a minimum investment cost. The proposed algorithm is investigated for WFLO problem and a set of 10 challenging real life benchmark problems. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method is an effective technique to solve the WFLO problem compared to its basic algorithm and other state of the art methods.

SCOPUS_ID:85019391553,"Fossil fuels serve a substantial fraction of global energy demand, and one major energy consumer is the global building stock. In this work, we propose a framework to guide practitioners intending to develop advanced predictive building control strategies. The framework provides the means to enhance legacy and modernized buildings regarding energy efficiency by integrating their available instrumentation into a data-driven predictive cyber-physical system. For this, the framework fuses two highly relevant approaches and embeds these into the building context: the generic model-based design methodology for cyber-physical systems and the cross-industry standard process for data mining. A Spanish school's heating system serves to validate the approach. Two different data-driven approaches to prediction and optimization are used to demonstrate the methodological flexibility: (i) a combination of Bayesian regularized neural networks with genetic algorithm based optimization, and (ii) a reinforcement learning based control logic using fitted Q-iteration are both successfully applied. Experiments lasting a total of 43 school days in winter 2015/2016 achieved positive effects on weather-normalized energy consumption and thermal comfort in day-to-day operation. A first experiment targeting comfort levels comparable to the reference period lowered consumption by one-third. Two additional experiments raised average indoor temperatures by 2K. The better of these two experiments only consumed 5% more energy than the reference period.

SCOPUS_ID:85025426669,"This research proposes a novel approach to improve the ability to forecast low frequency extreme events of transport-related pollution in urban areas using a limited input data set. The approach is based on the idea of a self-managing model, able to adapt to unexpected changes in pollution level. In more detail, for a given combination of variables, it selects the most suitable prediction model within a set of alternative air quality models, estimated for a wider range of locations and conditions.
                  In this study, the new approach is tested for the prediction of nitrogen dioxide concentration in the United Kingdom (UK), specifically in an air quality monitoring site of the Greater Manchester Area, by comparing it with a context-specific statistical model (ARIMAX). The analysis results show that the two methods are similar in terms of global covariance and difference between observed and simulated concentrations, however the performance of the new approach in the prediction of extreme air pollution events is up to 27% better than the standard statistical approach and up to 113% better than the artificial neural network method.",Catalano M.,2017-08-01,Enhanced transport-related air pollution prediction through a novel metamodel approach
SCOPUS_ID:85018293545,"In the context of the growth slowdown in China, it is important to accurately forecast the future economic trend to guide policy-makers the direction of adjusting their current economic policies. In this paper, we intend to predict Beijing's tertiary industry, whose datasets are small, irregular and non-stationary, leading to a difficulty of building an accurate prediction model. To this end, we present an improved grey model, named PRGM(1,1), which extends the grey prediction model by integrating two techniques, i.e., the particle swarm optimization algorithm for parameter optimization and the exponential preprocessing method for data cleaning. The experimental results show that PRGM(1,1) outperforms other variants of the grey prediction model in predicting Beijing's tertiary industry, and is viable to do reasonable prediction over short and fluctuated economic data sequences. In addition, we employ PRGM(1,1) in the economic prediction of Beijing's tertiary industry in the next five years, and conclude that the growth rate will decelerate. Our prediction result seems to be in line with the economic slowdown in China this year.",Wang Q.,2017-08-01,Predicting Beijing's tertiary industry with an improved grey model

Control plans are developed for zone cooling and according to occupancy patterns at zone levels, and using a novel response model developed in this paper. The thermal response model is a statistical model, which is built on the basis of insights gained from physics-based model of zone thermal behavior. The control model attempts to optimize cooling system scheduling on the basis of occupancy patterns, price signal from utilities and human comfort and productivity. The optimization follows an on-demand routine, such that zone level air conditioning starts at a time epoch that is optimal according to zone thermal response and cooling requirements. We toss the term “pre-occupy” control. We also develop, what we call, “post-occupy” control, where the system shutdown follows thermal inertia and cooling requirements at the time that the zone is expected to become unoccupied. The thermal response modeling of a zone and the two control modes are considered major contributions of this article.

SCOPUS_ID:85008500680,"Consumer promotions are an important element of competitive dynamics in retail markets and make a significant difference in the retailer's profits. But no study has so far included all the elements that are required to meet retail business objectives. We extend the existing literatures by considering all the basic requirements for a promotional Decision Support System (DSS): reliance on operational (store-level) data only, the ability to predict sales as a function of prices and the inclusion of other promotional variables affecting the category. The new model delivers an optimizing promotional schedule at Stock-Keeping-Unit (SKU) level which maximizes multi-period category level profit under the constraints of business rules typically applied in practice. We first develop a high dimensional distributed lag demand model which integrates both cross-SKU competitive promotion information and cross-period promotional influences. We estimate the model by proposing a two stage sign constrained regularization approach to ensure realistic promotional parameters. Based on the demand model, we then build a nonlinear integer programming model to maximize the retailer's category profits over a planning horizon under constraints that model important business rules. The output of the model provides optimized prices, display and feature advertising planning together with sales and profit forecasts. Empirical tests over a number of stores and categories using supermarket data suggest that our model generates accurate sales forecasts and increases category profits by approximately 17% and that including cross-item and cross-period effects is also valuable.",Ma S.,2017-07-16,A retail store SKU promotions optimization model for category multi-period profit maximization
SCOPUS_ID:85018784236,"In residential buildings, occupant behavior and occupancy status have a significant impact on energy consumption variation. Although the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends a uniform occupancy schedule for building energy assessment, occupant behavior patterns and schedules could be different for each building due to occupants’ lifestyles, preferences, occupations, and other differences. Existing occupant behavior models focus on analyzing occupants’ sociodemographic characteristics to predict their energy consumption with statistical approaches. This paper proposes to identify and classify occupants’ behavior with direct energy consumption outcomes and energy time use data through unsupervised clustering. Based on the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), the proposed approach integrates k-modes clustering and demographic-based probability neural networks and identifies 10 distinctive behavior patterns. With the results of the behavior classification and simulation, a bottom-up engineering model reveals that the proposed behavior model offers a more accurate and reliable prediction than the ASHRAE standard schedule. With qualified and sufficient time use data, the model is capable of automatically estimating energy consumption on even larger geographic scales.",Diao L.,2017-07-15,Modeling energy consumption in residential buildings: A bottom-up analysis based on occupant behavior pattern clustering and stochastic simulation

SCOPUS_ID:85017354159,"Electrical energy is fundamental for the wellbeing and for the economic development of any country. However, all countries must ensure access to essential resources and ensure the continuity of its supply. Due to the non-storable nature of electrical energy, the amount of consumed active power should always be equal the produced active power just to avoid power system frequency deviation problem. In order to keep the relationship production–consumption relation in compliance with different standards and to secure profitable operations of power system, electric load consumption must be predicted and controlled instantaneously. Several statistical and classical techniques are proposed in the literature but unfortunately all these methods are not accurate in a satisfactory manner. In this paper, a dynamic neural network is used for the prediction of daily power consumption. The suitability and the performance of the proposed approach is illustrated and verified with simulations on load data collected from French Transmission System Operator (RTE) website.

SCOPUS_ID:85018471278,"Contemporary Content Delivery Networks (CDN) handle a vast number of content items. At such a scale, the replication schemes require a significant amount of time to calculate and realize cache updates, and hence they are impractical in highly-dynamic environments. This paper introduces cluster-based replication, whereby content items are organized in clusters according to a set of features, given by the cache/network management entity. Each cluster is treated as a single item with certain attributes, e.g., size, popularity, etc. and it is then altogether replicated in network caches so as to minimize overall network traffic. Clustering items reduces replication complexity; hence it enables faster and more frequent caches updates, and it facilitates more accurate tracking of content popularity. However, clustering introduces some performance loss because replication of clusters is more coarse-grained compared to replication of individual items. This tradeoff can be addressed through proper selection of the number and composition of clusters. Due to the fact that the exact optimal number of clusters cannot be derived analytically, an efficient approximation method is proposed. Extensive numerical evaluations of time-varying content popularity scenarios allow to argue that the proposed approach reduces core network traffic, while being robust to errors in popularity estimation.",Gkatzikis L.,2017-07-05,Low complexity content replication through clustering in Content-Delivery Networks

SCOPUS_ID:85031827079,"Erratic demand patterns are common in spare parts supply networks. Owing to the characteristics of nonlinear dynamics, aperiodic variations and deep uncertainties, erratic demand forecasting remains to be a challenge. This paper is devoted to forecast this type of demand in a more difficult situation where regular explanatory variables are not available and historical data are limited. To address this problem, we propose an Adaptive Autoregressive Support Vector Machine model in which: 1) autocorrelated attributes are generated from historical demand time-series data automatically; 2) the attribute dimension and the suitable nonlinear kernel mapping function are identified in a data-driven manner; and 3) key model parameters are adaptively controlled by a parallel heuristic algorithm to cope with data uncertainties and guarantee the model generalization ability. We test this model by erratic demands of heavy truck spare parts. Computational results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms seven sound time-series forecasting models and general Support Vector Machine models.",Jiang P.,2017-07-01,An Adaptive Data-driven Model for Erratic Demand Forecasting

SCOPUS_ID:85019554375,"This research develops a sales forecasting model that can analyze the interaction effects of two retail competing formats (convenience-oriented vs. budget-oriented formats). A traditional approach to making such a forecast is based on the Lotka–Volterra equations (also called the LV-model). The LV-model assumes that the population of each species is affected by its self-growth, internal interaction within the species, and external interaction with other species. Most prior studies in business applications directly use sales data as input to the LV-model. The prior approach may result in misleading conclusions when sales data are embedded with seasonal variation, because this variation is not addressed in the original development of the LV-model. Therefore, this study proposes a forecasting framework (an enhanced application of the LV-model). The sales data of each retail format is considered as a compound data, which is decomposed into three individual components: (1) aggregate, (2) competition, and (3) seasonal components. The LV-model is used to forecast the competition component; the other two components are forecasted by typical time series methods; and the data of three components are finally combined into one. Empirical study indicates that the proposed method substantially outperforms the prior approach in terms of forecasting errors (4.4% vs. 16.7% for convenience-oriented and 5.8% vs. 16.2% for budget-oriented). In addition, the proposed method reveals a more convincing predator-prey relationship between the two retail formats, which concludes that the convenience-oriented is the predator. To the opposite, the prior approach, concluding that the budget-oriented is the predator, is quite doubtful because the convenience-oriented shall be preferred while the GDP grows over time. This research makes a contribution in how to appropriately apply the LV-model in forecasting revenue and analyzing the interaction effects of two competing business species.",Hung H.-C.,2017-07-01,An enhanced application of Lotka–Volterra model to forecast the sales of two competing retail formats

Computers can produce statistical forecasts, but these are often adjusted judgmentally to take into account factors such as market intelligence. We explore the effects of two potential influences on these adjustments: the forecaster’s involvement with the product category and their emotional reactions to particular products. Two forecasting experiments were conducted using data from a major Italian leather fashion goods producer. The participants’ judgmental adjustments tended to lower the forecast accuracy, but especially when the participants had strong preferences for particular products. This appeared to result from a false consensus effect. The most accurate forecasts were made when the participants had no knowledge of the product and only received time series information, though a high level of involvement with the product category also led to a greater accuracy.",Belvedere V.,2017-07-01,The influence of product involvement and emotion on short-term product demand forecasting
SCOPUS_ID:85019899635,"Land-cover change, a major driver of the distribution and functioning of ecosystems, is characterized by a high diversity of patterns of change across space and time. Thus, a large amount of information is necessary to analyse change and develop plans for proper management of natural resources. In this work we tested MaxEnt algorithm in a completely remote land-cover classification and change analysis. In order to provide an empirical example, we selected south-eastern Italian Alps, manly Trentino-South Tyrol, as test region. We classified two Landsat images (1976 and 2001) in order to forecast probability of occurrence for unsampled locations and to determine the best subset of predictors (spectral bands). A difference map for each land cover class, representing the difference between 1976 and 2001 probability of occurrence values, was built. In order to better address the patterns of change analysis, we put together difference maps and topographic variables. The latter are considered, at least in the study area, as the main environmental drivers of land-use change, in connection with climate change. Our results indicate that the selected algorithm, applied to land cover classes, can provide reliable data, especially when referring to classes with homogeneous texture properties and surface reflectance. The performed models had satisfactory predictive performance, showing relatively clear patterns of difference between the two considered time steps. The development of a methodology that, in the absence of field data, allow to obtain data on land use change dynamics, is of extreme importance for land planning and management.",Amici V.,2017-07-01,A multi-temporal approach in MaxEnt modelling: A new frontier for land use/land cover change detection
SCOPUS_ID:85015358574,"When a highly automated car reaches its operational limits, it needs to provide a take-over request (TOR) in order for the driver to resume control. The aim of this simulator-based study was to investigate the effects of TOR modality and left/right directionality on drivers' steering behaviour when facing a head-on collision without having received specific instructions regarding the directional nature of the TORs. Twenty-four participants drove three sessions in a highly automated car, each session with a different TOR modality (auditory, vibrotactile, and auditory-vibrotactile). Six TORs were provided per session, warning the participants about a stationary vehicle that had to be avoided by changing lane left or right. Two TORs were issued from the left, two from the right, and two from both the left and the right (i.e., nondirectional). The auditory stimuli were presented via speakers in the simulator (left, right, or both), and the vibrotactile stimuli via a tactile seat (with tactors activated at the left side, right side, or both). The results showed that the multimodal TORs yielded statistically significantly faster steer-touch times than the unimodal vibrotactile TOR, while no statistically significant differences were observed for brake times and lane change times. The unimodal auditory TOR yielded relatively low self-reported usefulness and satisfaction ratings. Almost all drivers overtook the stationary vehicle on the left regardless of the directionality of the TOR, and a post-experiment questionnaire revealed that most participants had not realized that some of the TORs were directional. We conclude that between the three TOR modalities tested, the multimodal approach is preferred. Moreover, our results show that directional auditory and vibrotactile stimuli do not evoke a directional response in uninstructed drivers. More salient and semantically congruent cues, as well as explicit instructions, may be needed to guide a driver into a specific direction during a take-over scenario.",Petermeijer S.,2017-07-01,Take-over again: Investigating multimodal and directional TORs to get the driver back into the loop

SCOPUS_ID:85019842520,"In this paper we present an innovative framework for an economic risk analysis of drought impacts on irrigated agriculture. It consists on the integration of three components: stochastic time series modelling for prediction of inflows and future reservoir storages at the beginning of the irrigation season; statistical regression for the evaluation of water deliveries based on projected inflows and storages; and econometric modelling for economic assessment of the production value of agriculture based on irrigation water deliveries and crop prices. Therefore, the effect of the price volatility can be isolated from the losses due to water scarcity in the assessment of the drought impacts. Monte Carlo simulations are applied to generate probability functions of inflows, which are translated into probabilities of storages, deliveries, and finally, production value of agriculture. The framework also allows the assessment of the value of mitigation measures as reduction of economic losses during droughts.
                  The approach was applied to the Jucar river basin, a complex system affected by multiannual severe droughts, with irrigated agriculture as the main consumptive demand. Probability distributions of deliveries and production value were obtained for each irrigation season. In the majority of the irrigation districts, drought causes a significant economic impact. The increase of crop prices can partially offset the losses from the reduction of production due to water scarcity in some districts. Emergency wells contribute to mitigating the droughts’ impacts on the Jucar river system.",Lopez-Nicolas A.,2017-07-01,Economic risk assessment of drought impacts on irrigated agriculture
SCOPUS_ID:85019158882,"Strategic business planning requires forecasted information that contains a sufficient level of detail that reflects trends, seasonality, and changes while also minimizing the level of effort needed to develop and assess the forecasted information. The balance of information is most often achieved by grouping the customer population into segments; planning is then based on segments instead of individuals.
                  Ideally, separating customers into segments uses descriptive variables to identify similar behavior expectations. In some domains, however, descriptive variables are not available or are not adequate for distinguishing differences and similarities between customers. The authors solved this problem by applying data mining methods to identify behavior patterns in historical noisy delivery data. The revealed behavior patterns and subsequent market segmentation are suitable for strategic decision-making.

SCOPUS_ID:85015091879,"In a heterogeneous Cloud network scenario where a Cloud computing data center serves mobile Cloud computing requests, Cloud providers are expected to implement more innovative and effective solutions for a list of long standing challenges. Energy efficiency in the Cloud data center is one of the more pressing issues near the top of that list. Cloud providers are in constant pursuit of a system that satisfies client demands for resources, maximizes availability and other service level agreement metrics while minimizing energy consumption and, in turn, minimizing Cloud providers' cost.
                  In this work, we introduce a novel mathematical optimization model to solve the problem of energy efficiency in a cloud data center. Next, we offer a solution based on VM migration that tackles this problem and minimizes energy efficiency in comparison to other common solutions. This solution includes a novel proposed technique to be integrated in any consolidation-based energy efficiency solution. This technique depends on dynamic idleness prediction (DIP) using machine learning classifiers. Moreover, we offer a robust energy efficiency scheduling solution that does not depend on live migration. This technique, termed Smart VM Over Provision (SVOP), offers a major advantage to cloud providers in the cases when live migration of VMs is not preferred due to its effects on performance. We evaluate the aforementioned solutions in terms of a number of critical metrics, namely, energy used per server, energy used per served request, acceptance rate, and the number of migrations performed.",Abu Sharkh M.,2017-07-01,An evergreen cloud: Optimizing energy efficiency in heterogeneous cloud computing architectures

We present an activity forecasting method to predict the time that will elapse until a target activity occurs. This method generates an activity forecast using a regression tree classifier and offers an advantage over sequence prediction methods in that it can predict expected time until an activity occurs. We evaluate this algorithm on real-world smart home datasets and provide evidence that our proposed approach is most effective at predicting activity timings.",Minor B.,2017-07-01,Forecasting occurrences of activities

Nineteen quantitative features characterizing the reviews, hotels and the users were prepared and used for feeding a support vector machine for modeling the score. The results achieved reveal the model demonstrated adequate predictive performance. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis was applied over the model for extracting useful knowledge translated into features' relevance for the score. The findings unveiled user features related to TripAdvisor membership experience play a key role in influencing the scores granted, clearly surpassing hotel features. Also, both seasonality and the day of the week were found to influence scores. Such knowledge may be helpful in directing efforts to answer online reviews in alignment with hotel strategies, by profiling the reviews according to the member and review date.",Moro S.,2017-07-01,Stripping customers' feedback on hotels through data mining: The case of Las Vegas Strip

The main contribution of this work is to propose a distributed optimization structure to have a better integration of local production. More precisely, instead of having a centralized solution, whose optimization is hard to solve and does not preserve the privacy of the consumers, a distributed solution is proposed, using price inducements. This price is deduced iteratively from an adaptation of augmented Lagrangian technique. The performances of the proposed strategy is compared with the centralized control and a ”do nothing” approach.",Muller A.,2017-07-01,Dynamic Pricing for Local Energy Management : Towards a Better Integration of Local Production
SCOPUS_ID:85014561746,"In the last decade, the share of renewable energy sources in the energy mix has risen significantly in many countries, and the large-scale integration of these intermittent energy sources constitutes a major challenge to the power grid. A crucial building block of a successful transformation of today's energy systems is the use of energy storage, either co-located with renewable energy sources or on a grid-level.
                  To this end, we present a model on the basis of a Markov Decision Process for the short-term trading of intermittent energy production co-located with energy storage. The model explicitly considers the time lag between trade and delivery of energy, which is characteristic for energy markets. Our storage representation includes asymmetrical conversion losses, asymmetrical power, and self-discharge. Stochastic production and market prices are represented by ARIMA processes, and the producer may also undertake price arbitrage by purchasing energy on the market when prices are comparatively low.
                  Regarding the solution of our model, we develop several intuitive and easily interpretable decision rules that can be readily applied in practice. An extensive numerical study, based on real-world data, confirms the excellent performance of these rules in comparison to a sophisticated Approximate Dynamic Programming algorithm adapted from literature.",Hassler M.,2017-07-01,Heuristic decision rules for short-term trading of renewable energy with co-located energy storage

SCOPUS_ID:85019637612,"In this paper, typical flight paths, fuel burn and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are computed using a rich data set and two estimation approaches: (i) a clustering and landmark registration technique and (ii) a method based on the EUROCONTROL’s Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) performance model. Clustering is employed to extract flight characteristics and organize altitude profiles accordingly. Our flight path and CO2 emissions analysis focuses on the Climb-Cruise-Descent (CCD) cycle, since different operational conditions during the Landing and Take-off cycle may result in significant deviations in terms of fuel burn and CO2 emissions and different modeling assumptions and approaches should be adopted. The key features of the CCD cycle are the flight distance, the aircraft type and the flight direction. Path segmentation and landmark registration are employed for path representation and smoothening of discontinuities. The paths estimated by the above method are compared to those obtained by the point mass BADA model. Noticeable deviations in the resulting estimates of the operational characteristics are found. Higher deviations in prediction errors are found in the climb and descent duration and the rate of climb and descent. The typical altitude profiles obtained by the two methods are used to determine fuel burn and CO2 emissions. The difference in the resulting estimates are less stark; on a fleet-wide level the fuel burn of the relevant typical profiles differ by 7%. Emission maps of the U.S. airspace enabling the identification of critical emission spots including routes, airports, seasons and aircraft type are constructed.",Pagoni I.,2017-07-01,Calculation of aircraft fuel consumption and CO2 emissions based on path profile estimation by clustering and registration

In-situ measurements from 2008 to 2013 revealed that both ice temperature and velocity are obviously higher than in other glaciers in this region. Comparison of digitized earlier topographic maps with recent satellite images indicates that the glacier had been retreating and thinning during the past decades. Between 1964 and 2008, its terminus retreat and area reduction was 41.16±0.6ma−1 and 0.034±0.030×10−3

The strongest ablation and terminus retreat occurred at the end of the last century and the beginning of this century rather than in most recent years, seeming to be related to increase in the debris coverage and thickness. The debris-covered area was 0.87km2, of which 0.66km2 is thicker than the critical thickness of 4cm, and thus the debris cover on this glacier has an alleviating ablation effect overall.

SCOPUS_ID:85016000527,"Time series forecasting is of fundamental importance in big data analysis. The prediction of noisy, non-stationary, and chaotic time series demands good generalization from small amounts of data. Vapnik showed that the total risk is dependent on both, empirical error as well as model complexity, where the latter may be measured in terms of the Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. In other words, good generalization requires minimizing model complexity. The recently proposed Minimal Complexity Machine (MCM) has been shown to minimize a tight bound on the VC dimension, and has further been extended to Minimal Complexity Machine Regression (MCMR). In this paper, we present an original approach based on the MCM regressor, which builds sparse and accurate models for short-term time series forecasting. Results on a number of datasets establish that the proposed approach is superior to a number of state-of-the-art methods, and yields sparse models. These sparse models are able to extract only the most important information present in the data sets, thereby achieving high accuracy. Sparsity in time series forecasting models is also important in reducing the evaluation time. This assumes importance when the models need to be evaluated in real time, such as when they are used as part of trading flows.",Gupta P.,2017-06-21,Sparse short-term time series forecasting models via minimum model complexity

The model took account of jet hydrodynamics, mass transfer and thermodynamic properties of SC-CO2. Formulas of the density, viscosity and thermal conductivity of CO2 were verified for a supercritical state, and they were embedded in a CFD model through the user defined function (UDF). Complex coupling was achieved with the modified SIMPLE segmentation algorithm, and fields of the SC-CO2 impact flow, pressure, temperature and physical parameters were obtained. The reliability of the numerical model was validated in experiments that monitored the pressure and temperature of SC-CO2 impacting jet using sensors. The laboratory experiments show that the model accurately predicts the temperature and pressure fields of SC-CO2 impacting jet. SC-CO2 impacting jet has a more obvious thermal effect on the wall without any phenomena of CO2 freezing and blocking nozzle.

This research introduces a data-mining based method to systematically assess the national innovation gap that is specifically for emerging industries. The method examines the five key attributes of emerging industries, including the ownership of platform technologies, globalization intention, international knowledge position, university-industry linkage, and cross-disciplinary technology development. In particular, this method combines data-mining with experts' knowledge to build patent-training examples, and then uses a support vector machine-based classifier to single out all high-quality patents for each innovation attribute. Based on the selected high-quality patents, the authors utilize a factorial design analysis to systematically evaluate the innovation gap between countries. This method can significantly reduce measurement bias of traditional single patent indicators. In addition, it also can robustly adjust measuring weights in response to the specifics of each innovation attribute, while traditional multi-attribute evaluation methods cannot. As a result, this research empirically shows that China' industrial robot sector has apparent innovation gaps compared to developed economies, specifically in university-industry linkage, cross-disciplinary competence, and globalization intention, and this calls for the attention of policy makers and industrial experts.",Kong D.,2017-06-01,Using the data mining method to assess the innovation gap: A case of industrial robotics in a catching-up country

However, due to the highly agglomerated state of the NPs and significant pre-combustion sintering, ignition and combustion are not as facile as they could be. In this work, we employed a spray approach to generate near monodisperse microparticles of Al NP's encapsulated within ammonium perchlorate (AP) and a binder (nitrocellulose (NC)) The results show that Al/AP/NC composites have an ignition temperature (∼700K), which is significantly lower than Al melting point (∼933K). The reactivity of Al/AP/NC composites was also tested in a confined cell where we find that although the peak pressure for Al/AP/NC is comparable to that of physically mixed Al/CuO nanothermite, the impulse generated is more than two times higher. The measured flame temperature of Al/AP/NC composites were as high as 2800K, which is ∼500K higher than Al/AP composites without NC. Furthermore, the potential mechanism for the early ignition of these composites were investigated. It is proposed that gaseous acid released from AP could play an important role in weakening the protective oxide shell on Al nanoparticles which could subsequently lead to the reaction of Al in the high-pressure oxygenated environment at lower temperature.",Wang Z.,2017-06-01,Regional wind power forecasting model with NWP grid data optimized
SCOPUS_ID:85013779852,"Electricity load demand estimation has a remarkable impact on the economic policies of power industry and business cycles. Forecasting the movements of load demand provides to know the tendency of the future and can lead to a clear decision in strategic planning or investments. Besides the ability to know the fluctuations of the future values contributes to the management of daily/weekly and long term operations. This study aims to predict the electricity load demand using a hybrid method that incorporates Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithms. The proposed EMD-SVR method integrates the EMD method to SVR algorithm by using EMD as a denoising step on the training data. Unlike the previous studies, the proposed algorithm is not dependent to a specific Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) for denoising and model learning.

SCOPUS_ID:85029810181,"The present work deals with the study of adsorption of isonicotinic acid (iNA) onto Amberlite IR120 H. Equilibrium and kinetic experiments are carried out to determine the effect of adsorbent dose (10g/L to 70g/L) initial concentration of iNA (0.01M to 0.05M), contact time (0 to 40min) and temperature (298 to 333K) on the capacity of the adsorbent. With an increase in the adsorbent dosage, the uptake capacity of adsorbent is found to decrease but with an enhancement in the recovery efficiency. The optimum dosage of adsorbent is found to be 50g/L. In the kinetic experiments, the percentage removal of iNA reaches to a constant value of 95% with Amberlite IR120 H (50g/L) after 30min. Increased temperature shows reverse trend in the removal efficiency of iNA. The change in enthalpy and entropy are estimated to be −8.80kJ/mol and −19.78J/mol/K, respectively. Equilibrium data are analyzed by using Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models.

SCOPUS_ID:85007557437,"This paper presents a decision support system (DSS) for multi-objective dispatch of an electric microgrid considering cost of operation, peak load reduction, and emissions. Discrete compromise programming (DCP) is used as the multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) technique for providing the decision support to the distribution system operator (DSO) by ranking various alternatives based on preference of the objectives. The focus of this paper is the application of DCP-based MCDA to select feasible dispatch solutions closest to the preference of the DSO when multiple objectives are considered in the microgrid dispatch. This technique obtains non-dominated solutions in case of conflicting objectives without generating a Pareto front, and hence avoiding prohibitive computational cost. DCP can be used for MCDA in both exact and metaheuristic dispatch algorithms. Uncertainty in renewable energy forecasting and load demand is included through a scenario-based approach by sampling empirical distributions. The dispatch algorithm considers a two hour look-ahead time horizon. Simulations are performed on a notional electric microgrid with diesel generator, solar photovoltaic, and energy storage.

SCOPUS_ID:84952910208,"This study investigated the determination of the allowance that must be added to the cycle time estimate, which is a critical concern when assigning internal due dates. Because no method for estimating cycle times is completely accurate, producing such estimates remains problematic but has rarely been addressed in the literature. A large allowance postpones the internal due date, diminishing company appeal when a factory manager negotiates with a customer. Therefore, in this study, a nonlinear approach was proposed to normalize the cycle times. After estimating the cycle time of a job by using a back propagation network, the allowance added to the cycle time can be effectively reduced through the collaboration of several computing clouds. Theoretical properties of the proposed method were validated, and a case from a wafer fabrication factory was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with various existing methods. According to the experimental results, the proposed method facilitated establishing tight upper bounds on the cycle times. The proposed method was proven to be very effective.",Chen T.,2017-06-01,A nonlinearly normalized back propagation network and cloud computing approach for determining cycle time allowance during wafer fabrication

The morphology of the Ag nanostructures can be controlled by the electrodepositing time, applied potentials, and the concentrations of Ag ions. The AgNDs/TCNQ/GCE obtained at the optimized conditions displays the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) onset potential of 0.98V, which is the same as that over Pt/C-JM catalyst (0.98V). It demonstrated that AgNDs possessed the highest electrocatalytic activity for ORR among the various Ag-based electrocatalysts reported in literature in alkaline electrolyte. At the same time, the performance of AgNDs/TCNQ/GCE toward hydrogen peroxide detection was investigated in a range of the concentration from 10μM to 17mM. It also showed the higher catalytic activity for hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction with the hydrogen peroxide detection limit reaching 0.47μM level. The Tafel polarization curve, electrochemically active surface area, and the electrochemical impedance were measured to understand and explore the catalytic behavior of the prepared AgNDs/TCNQ/GCE. The enhanced performance of AgNDs for ORR and hydrogen peroxide detection can be ascribed to the special tree-like morphology with highly-exposed surface and the improved electron transportation capacity of interface between AgNDs and GCE.",Chen D.,2017-05-16,SunDance: Black-box behind-the-meter solar disaggregation

SCOPUS_ID:85027947098,"Despite recent promising developments with large datasets and machine learning, the idea that automation alone can discover all key relationships between factors of interest remains a challenging task. Indeed, in many real-world domains, experts can often understand and identify key relationships that data alone may fail to discover, no matter how large the dataset. Hence, while pure machine learning provides obvious benefits, these benefits may come at a cost of accuracy. Here we focus on what we call smart-data; a method which supports data engineering and knowledge engineering approaches that put greater emphasis on applying causal knowledge and real-world ‘facts’ to the process of model development, driven by what data are really required for prediction, rather than by what data are available. We demonstrate how we exploited knowledge to develop a model that generates accurate predictions of the evolving performance of football teams based on limited data. The model enables us to predict, before a season starts, the total league points a team is expected to accumulate throughout the season. The results compare favourably against a number of other relevant and different types of models, and are on par with some other models which use far more data. The model results also provide a novel and comprehensive attribution study of the factors most influencing change in team performance, and partly address the cause of the widely accepted favourite-longshot bias observed in bookies odds.",Constantinou A.,2017-05-15,Towards smart-data: Improving predictive accuracy in long-term football team performance

Based on a three-stage approach, our empirical evidence suggests that a one-time monetary-easing shock can significantly trigger house price booms in Euro area countries with liberal mortgage markets. Such shocks can explain over 20% of the forecasting error variance of non-fundamental house price runups in Ireland and Spain. We find that, in countries with more regulated mortgage markets, monetary policy stance does not significantly affect non-fundamental house prices. Policymakers may wish to focus on limiting mortgage equity withdrawals and on monitoring loan-to-value ratios and tax policies in order to minimize the side effects of accommodative monetary policies on housing market stability for Euro area countries.

An ensemble method composed of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) algorithm and deep learning approach is presented in this work. For this purpose, the load demand series were first decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then a Deep Belief Network (DBN) including two restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) was used to model each of the extracted IMFs, so that the tendencies of these IMFs can be accurately predicted. Finally, the prediction results of all IMFs can be combined by either unbiased or weighted summation to obtain an aggregated output for load demand. The electricity load demand data sets from Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) are used to test the effectiveness of the proposed EMD-based DBN approach.

This paper develops a novel load forecasting model, which is based on a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN), to predict hourly load demand for various seasons of a year. In this model, a global best particle swarm optimization (GPSO) algorithm is applied as a new training technique to enhance the performance of ANN prediction.

However, it is both a difficult and challenging problem to achieve high-precision forecasting for the wind speed because the original sequence includes many nonlinear stochastic signals. The current conventional forecasting methods are more suitable for capturing linear trends, and artificial neural networks easily fall into a local optimum. This paper proposes a model that combines a denoising method with a dynamic fuzzy neural network to address the problems above. Singular spectrum analysis optimized by brain storm optimization is applied to preprocess the original wind speed data to obtain a smoother sequence, and a generalized dynamic fuzzy neural network is utilized to perform the forecasting. With a smaller and simpler structure of the neural network, the model can effectively achieve a rapid learning rate and accurate forecasting. Three experimental results, which cover 10-min, 30-min and 60-min interval wind speed time series data, demonstrate that the model can both satisfactorily approximates the actual value and be used as an effective and simple tool for the planning of smart grids.",Ma X.,2017-05-01,A generalized dynamic fuzzy neural network based on singular spectrum analysis optimized by brain storm optimization for short-term wind speed forecasting
SCOPUS_ID:85004039859,"This paper assesses the feasibility of determining key household characteristics based on temporal load profiles of household electricity demand. It is known that household characteristics, behaviours and routines drive a number of features of household electricity loads in ways which are currently not fully understood. The roll out of domestic smart meters in the UK and elsewhere could enable better understanding through the collection of high temporal resolution electricity monitoring data at the household level. Such data affords tremendous potential to invert the established relationship between household characteristics and temporal load profiles. Rather than use household characteristics as a predictor of loads, observed electricity load profiles, or indicators based on them, could instead be used to impute household characteristics. These micro level imputed characteristics could then be aggregated at the small area level to produce ‘census-like’ small area indicators. This work briefly reviews the nature of current and future census taking in the UK before outlining the household characteristics that are to be found in the UK census and which are also known to influence electricity load profiles. It then presents descriptive analysis of a large scale smart meter-like dataset of half-hourly domestic electricity consumption before reviewing the correlation between household attributes and electricity load profiles. The paper then reports the results of multilevel model-based analysis of these relationships. The work concludes that a number of household characteristics of the kind to be found in UK census-derived small area statistics may be predicted from particular load profile indicators. A discussion of the steps required to test and validate this approach and the wider implications for census taking is also provided.",Anderson B.,2017-05-01,Electricity consumption and household characteristics: Implications for census-taking in a smart metered future

In the first stage, a stochastic model is developed to calculate the probability of having a “triad” on a daily and half-hourly basis and to generate an alert to the building manager if a triad is detected. In the second stage, weather data is analysed and included in the model to increase its forecasting accuracy. In the third stage, an ANN forecasting model is developed to predict the power demand of the building at the periods when a “triad” peak is more likely to occur. The stochastic model has been trained on “triad” peak data from 1990 onwards, and validated against the actual UK “triad” dates and times over the period 2014/2015. The ANN forecasting model was trained on electricity demand data from six commercial buildings at a business park for one year. Local weather data for the same period were analysed and included to improve model accuracy. The electricity demand of each building on an actual “triad” peak date and time was predicted successfully, and an overall forecasting accuracy of 97.6% was demonstrated for the buildings being considered in the study.

                  Various therapies have been used to improve the symptoms and prognosis of patients with coronary artery disease. However, comparative studies showing more suitable choices for patients with ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) and who smoke cigarettes are lacking.
               
               
                  Methods
                  A total of 338 patients were divided into four groups according to whether they received complete revascularisation (CR), and/or underwent smoking cessation (SC). They were followed prospectively for 12 months. The major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs: all-cause mortality, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, repeat revascularisation, and AHF) were the primary endpoint, and decompensation necessitating hospitalisation and the combined endpoint thereof were secondary endpoints.
               
               
                  Results
                  During a mean follow-up of 12 months, the prevalence of MACCEs was significantly lower in patients receiving CR plus SC (CRSC) than in patients receiving CR only (CR), SC only (SC), and neither R nor SC (NoRSC) (CRSC 4.4% vs. CR 11.9, p<0.05; vs. SC 26.5%, p<0.001; vs. NoRSC 34.5%, p<0.001, respectively). At 12 months, CR plus SC induced the greatest clinical benefits of the secondary outcomes in the CRSC group (49.1% relative increase in LVEF; 89.8% decrease in NT-proBNP level; 30.9% decrease in LVEDD; 38.3% decrease in LVESD; 51.4% decrease in LVEDVi; 51.2% decrease in LVESVi; 96.4% decrease in hs-cTnT level; 93.5% decrease in CK-MB level; 91.1% decrease in hs-CRP level; 94.0% decrease in IL-6 level; 1.9-fold increase in eNOS level; 1.8-fold increase in NO level; 1.3-fold increase in NOS level, all p<0.001). Absence of revascularisation brought about fewer benefits, and those who continued smoking had worse outcomes.
               
               
                  Conclusions

How to simultaneously reduce K and N can give us insight and inspiration on designing an effective and accurate selection algorithm. To this end, this paper tries to integrate the selection of training subset and model for SVR, and proposes a nested particle swarm optimization (NPSO) by inheriting the model selection of the existing training subset based SVR (TS-SVR). This nested algorithm is achieved by adaptively and periodically estimating the search region of the optimal parameter setting for TS-SVR. Complex SVR, involving large-scale training data, can be seen as extensions of TS-SVRs, yielding a nested sequence of TS-SVRs with increasing sample size. The uniform design idea is transplanted to the above modeling process, and the convergence for the proposed model is proofed. By using two artificial regression problems, Boston housing and electric load in New South Wales as empirical data, the proposed approach is compared with the standard ones, the APSO-OTS-SVR, and other existing approaches.

SCOPUS_ID:85013156247,"Reliable and accurate short-term subway passenger flow prediction is important for passengers, transit operators, and public agencies. Traditional studies focus on regular demand forecasting and have inherent disadvantages in predicting passenger flows under special events scenarios. These special events may have a disruptive impact on public transportation systems, and should thus be given more attention for proactive management and timely information dissemination. This study proposes a novel multiscale radial basis function (MSRBF) network for forecasting the irregular fluctuation of subway passenger flows. This model is simplified using a matching pursuit orthogonal least squares algorithm through the selection of significant model terms to produce a parsimonious MSRBF model. Combined with transit smart card data, this approach not only exhibits superior predictive performance over prevailing computational intelligence methods for non-regular demand forecasting at least 30min prior, but also leverages network knowledge to enhance prediction capability and pinpoint vulnerable subway stations for crowd control measures.

From the perspective of demand-side management (DSM), electricity prices prediction can be regarded as a pattern recognition problem of classifying future electricity prices with respect to a predefined threshold. From a fresh perspective this paper develops an efficient framework, called TSS-RFE-MRMR based SVM (Time series segmentation, recursive feature elimination, and minimum redundancy maximum relevance based support vector machine), for providing estimates of price fluctuation over certain valuation domains and modeling high-dimensional electricity market price without adopting additional impact factors. It starts from adopting a novel feature space determination scheme, called principal component analysis-dynamic programming (PCA-DP) based time series segmentation. Then, the RFE-MRMR filter for significant features selection is implemented, where both redundant and less relevant features are progressively eliminated among the potential feature sets.

This article uses two real data sets from the textile industry to show that the predictive accuracy is highly correlated with cost savings when daily forecasts are used in cash management models. A new method is proposed to help cash managers estimate whether their efforts in improving the predictive accuracy are rewarded by proportional cost savings. Our results indicate the need for an analysis of the potential cost savings derived from improving the predictive accuracy. On that basis, the search for better forecasting models is in place in order to improve cash management.",Salas-Molina F.,2017-04-01,Empowering cash managers to achieve cost savings by improving predictive accuracy
SCOPUS_ID:85010953682,"Seasonal Auto Regressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (SARFIMA) is a well-known model for forecasting of seasonal time series that follow a long memory process. However, to better boost the accuracy of forecasts inside such data for nonlinear problem, in this study, a combination of Fuzzy Time Series (FTS) with SARFIMA is proposed. To build the proposed model, certain parameters requires to be estimated. Therefore, a reliable Evolutionary Algorithm namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is employed. As a case study, a seasonal long memory time series, i.e., short term load consumption historical data, is selected. In fact, Short Term Load Forecasting (STLF) plays a key role in energy management systems (EMS) and in the decision making process of every power supply organization. In order to evaluate the proposed method, some experiments, using eight datasets of half-hourly load data from England and France for the year 2005 and four data sets of hourly load data from Malaysia for the year 2007, are designed. Although the focus of this research is STLF, six other seasonal long memory time series from several interesting case studies are employed to better evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results are compared with some novel FTS methods and new state-of-the-art forecasting methods. The analysis of the results indicates that the proposed method presents higher accuracy than its counterparts, representing an efficient hybrid method for load forecasting problems.",Sadaei H.J.,2017-04-01,"Short-term load forecasting method based on fuzzy time series, seasonality and long memory process"
SCOPUS_ID:85008224817,"It is important for building owners and operators to manage the electrical energy consumption of their buildings. As electrical energy is the major form of energy consumed in a commercial building, the ability to forecast electrical energy consumption in a building will bring great benefits to the building owners and operators. This paper provides a review of the building electrical energy consumption forecasting methods which include the conventional and artificial intelligence (AI) methods. The significant goal of this study is to review, recognize, and analyse the performance of both methods for forecasting of electrical energy consumption. Compared to using a single method of forecasting, the hybrid of two forecasting methods can possibly be applied for more precise results. Regarding this potential, the swarm intelligence (SI) method has been reviewed to be hybridized with AI. Published literature presented in this paper shows that, the hybrid of SVM and SI methods has indeed presented superior performance for forecasting building electrical energy consumption.",Mat Daut M.A.,2017-04-01,Building electrical energy consumption forecasting analysis using conventional and artificial intelligence methods: A review

Previous research has argued that this technology not only has profound effects on manufacturing businesses but also on society, which demands new corporate strategies and policies alike. Thus, the development of reliable future scenarios is key for strategic planning and decision making as well as for future research. Dedicated academic studies in this field remain scarce. We present the results of an extensive Delphi survey on the future of additive manufacturing with a focus on its economic and societal implications in 2030. Via an initial round of extensive qualitative interviews and a Delphi-based analysis of 3510 quantitative estimations and 1172 qualitative comments from 65 experts, we were able to develop and validate 18 projections that were then clustered into a scenario for the most probable future. The scenario is built on the six Delphi projections with the highest consensus on the likelihood of occurrence. We complement this most probable scenario with a discussion on controversial, extreme scenarios. Based on these findings we derive implications for industry, policy, and future research.",Jiang R.,2017-04-01,Predicting the future of additive manufacturing: A Delphi study on economic and societal implications of 3D printing for 2030

From comparison of these technologies we distill a stage model centering on the phenomenon of increasing scale while clarifying just what the concept of scale means in the context of process-based technologies. Process-based technologies turn out to be distinctive because of the temporal aspect of scaling; although scaling up usually refers to spatial dimensions of scale, this research highlights the temporal dimension to scale. Temporal scaling can be complemented by multiplicative scaling, a design innovation enabling multiple processes to be performed in parallel. After highlighting different patterns of innovation from those that characterize manufactured products as conveyed by classic product-process lifecycle models, we reconcile our stage model with these classic lifecycle models: although the sequence of innovation phases is different, the overall evolution of the underlying economic logic motivating technology developers is actually rather similar.",Lehrer M.,2017-04-01,When the sky is the limit on scale: From temporal to multiplicative scaling in process-based technologies

SCOPUS_ID:85013141343,"Harnessing the potential of new generation transport data and increasing public participation are high on the agenda for transport stakeholders and the broader community. The initial phase in the program of research reported here proposed a framework for mining transport-related information from social media, demonstrated and evaluated it using transport-related tweets associated with three football matches as case studies. The goal of this paper is to extend and complement the previous published studies. It reports an extended analysis of the research results, highlighting and elaborating the challenges that need to be addressed before a large-scale application of the framework can take place. The focus is specifically on the automatic harvesting of relevant, valuable information from Twitter. The results from automatically mining transport related messages in two scenarios are presented i.e. with a small-scale labelled dataset and with a large-scale dataset of 3.7m tweets. Tweets authored by individuals that mention a need for transport, express an opinion about transport services or report an event, with respect to different transport modes, were mined. The challenges faced in automatically analysing Twitter messages, written in Twitter’s specific language, are illustrated. The results presented show a strong degree of success in the identification of transport related tweets, with similar success in identifying tweets that expressed an opinion about transport services. The identification of tweets that expressed a need for transport services or reported an event was more challenging, a finding mirrored during the human based message annotation process. Overall, the results demonstrate the potential of automatic extraction of valuable information from tweets while pointing to areas where challenges were encountered and additional research is needed. The impact of a successful solution to these challenges (thereby creating efficient harvesting systems) would be to enable travellers to participate more effectively in the improvement of transport services.",Kuflik T.,2017-04-01,Automating a framework to extract and analyse transport related social media content: The potential and the challenges

SCOPUS_ID:84994383070,"Supply chains often experience significant economic losses from disruptions such as facility breakdowns, transportation mishaps, natural calamities, and intentional attacks. To help respond and recover from a disruption, we investigate adjustments in order activity across four echelons including assembly. Simulation experiments reveal that the impact of a disruption depends on its location, with costlier and longer lasting impacts occurring from disruptions at echelons close to ultimate consumption. Cost functions based on system inventory and service can be quite ill-behaved in these complex problem settings. Expediting, an adaptive ordering approach often used to mitigate disruptions, can trigger unintended bullwhip effects, and hurt rather than help overall performance. As an alternative to expediting interventions, dynamic order-up-to policies show promise as an adaptive mitigation tool. We also find benefits in the dynamic policies from incorporating a metaheuristic parameter search over multiple echelons, yielding significantly better solution quality than embedded unimodal search.",Schmitt T.G.,2017-04-01,Mitigating disruptions in a multi-echelon supply chain using adaptive ordering

SCOPUS_ID:85010218141,"According to the dynamic nature of cloud and the rapid growth of the resources demand in it, the resource provisioning is one of the challenging problems in the cloud environment. The resources should be allocated dynamically according to the demand changes of the application. Over-provisioning increases energy wasting and costs. On the other hand, under-provisioning causes Service Level Agreements (SLA) violation and Quality of Service (QoS) dropping. Therefore the allocated resources should be close to the current demand of applications as much as possible. Furthermore, the speed of response to the workload changes to achieve the desired performance level is a critical issue for cloud elasticity. For this purpose, the future demand of applications should be determined. Thus, the prediction of the application in different aspects (workload, performance) is an essential step before the resource provisioning. According to the prediction results, the sufficient resources are allocated to the applications in the appropriate time in a way that QoS is ensured and SLA violation is avoided. This paper reviews the state of the art application prediction methods in different aspects. Through a meticulous literature review of the state of the art application prediction schemes, a taxonomy for the application prediction models is presented that investigates main characteristics and challenges of the different models. Finally, open research issues and future trends of the application prediction are discussed.",Amiri M.,2017-03-15,Survey on prediction models of applications for resources provisioning in cloud

SCOPUS_ID:85007047688,"Low energy buildings (LEBs) are being considered as a promising solution for the built environment to satisfy high-energy efficiency standards. The technology is based on lowering the overall heat transmission coefficient value (U-value) of the buildings envelope and increasing a heat capacity thus creating a higher thermal inertia. However, LEB introduces a large time constant compared to conventional building due to which it slows the rate of heat transfer between interior of building and outdoor environment and alters the indoor climate regardless of sudden changes in climatic conditions. Therefore, it is challenging to estimate and predict thermal energy demand for such LEBs.
                  This work focuses on artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict energy consumption of LEB. Two kinds of AI modeling approaches: “all data” and “relevant data” are considered. The “all data” uses all available training data and “relevant data” uses a small representative day dataset and addresses the complexity of building non-linear dynamics by introducing past day climatic impacts behavior. This extraction is based on dynamic time warping pattern recognition methods. The case study consists of a French residential LEB. The numerical results showed that “relevant data” modeling approach that relies on small representative data selection has higher accuracy (R2
                     =0.98; RMSE=3.4) than “all data” modeling approach (R2

SCOPUS_ID:85019033347,"Some essential features of forest hydrologic cycles are based on observations of the soil water balance. However, measurements of soil water dynamics in subtropical forests have mostly been restricted to the upper 100cm of soil. The relative shallow depth in soil water measurement would bias the understanding how and to what extent soil water contributes to evapotranspiration. We investigated and compared the soil water dynamics down to 200cm depth over 7 years in four subtropical plantations, including one mixed stand type (Cunninghamia lanceolata mixed with Schima superba) and three pure stand types (C. lanceolata, Pinus elliottii, and Pinus massoniana). We also examined the variations in fine root distribution and tree basal area increment across stand types. We showed that, in contrast to the P. elliottii and P. massoniana stands, the C. lanceolata stand type extracted deep soil water when the top soil was still wet, depleted soil water over a longer season, but consumed less total soil water during the dry season. Our results revealed that the mixed stand type depleted more soil water during the dry season than the pure C. lanceolata stand type. In addition to the species-specific traits of water consumption, the different soil water depletion between stand types seems to be also accounted for by the different slope aspect and rock fragment content. During the entire dry season, the four stand types mainly relied on the soil water in the 100–200cm soil depth where fine root density was considerably low, however, the inter-annual variation in stem growth depended on the soil water depletion from 0 to 50cm soil layer. We conclude from these results that deep soil water is likely to make a significant contribution to drought avoidance over the dry period, but the available of shallow soil water to the fine roots during dry season may determine how well trees grow. This study highlights the important to consider the deep soil water extraction when explain the ecosystem evapotranspiration variations.",Yang S.,2017-03-01,Application of support vector machine in trip chaining pattern recognition and analysis of explanatory variable effects

However, brokers face great challenges, including the varying energy demands of consumers, the changing prices in the markets, and the competitions between each other. This paper proposes an intelligent broker model based on hybrid learning (including unsupervised, supervised and reinforcement learning), which generates smart trading strategies to adapt to the dynamics and complexity of Smart Grid markets. The proposed broker model comprises three interconnected modules. Customer demand prediction module predicts short-term demands of various consumers with a data-driven method. Wholesale market module employs a Markov Decision Process for the one-day-ahead power auction based on the predicted demand. Retail market module introduces independent reinforcement learning processes to optimize prices for different types of consumers to compete with other brokers in the retail market. We evaluate the proposed broker model on Power TAC platform. The experimental results show that our broker is not only is competitive in making profit, but also maintains a good supply-demand balance. In addition, we also discover two empirical laws in the competitive power market environment, which are: 1. profit margin shrinks when there are fierce competitions in markets; 2. the imbalance rate of supply demand increases when the market environment is more competitive.",Wang X.,2017-03-01,A hybrid-learning based broker model for strategic power trading in smart grid markets

SCOPUS_ID:85007072132,"In this paper, we propose the formation of agent cooperatives offering large-scale electricity demand shifting services, and put forward a complete framework for their operation. Individuals, represented by rational agents, form cooperatives to offer demand shifting from peak to non-peak intervals, incentivized by the provision of a better electricity price for the consumption of the shifted peak load, similar to economy of scale schemes. We equip the cooperatives with a novel, directly applicable, and effective consumption shifting scheme, that allows for the proactive balancing of electricity supply and demand. Our scheme employs several algorithms to promote the formation of the most effective shifting coalitions. It takes into account the shifting costs of the individuals, and rewards them according to their shifting efficiency. In addition, it employs internal pricing methods that guarantee individual rationality, and allow agents with initially forbidding costs to also contribute to the shifting effort. The truthfulness of agent statements regarding their shifting behaviour is ascertained via the incorporation of a strictly proper scoring rule. Moreover, by employing stochastic filtering techniques for effective individual performance monitoring, the scheme is able to better anticipate and tackle the uncertainty surrounding the actual agent shifting actions. We provide a thorough evaluation of our approach on a simulations setting constructed over a real-world dataset.

As the size of power systems expends and more flexible and distributed resources from the demand side are being involved in power systems, such a centralized framework raises computation and communication concerns. Distributed optimization, as an alternative approach to solve challenges of the centralized optimization mechanism, has attracted increasing attention recently. This paper reviews existing works on distributed optimization for power systems operation. We first discuss various distributed optimization algorithms that have been studied for power systems operation, followed by a detailed literature review on adopting such distributed algorithms for major power systems operation applications including distributed economic dispatch (ED), distributed AC-optimal power flow (OPF), distributed unit commitment (UC), and other distributed applications. The advantages and barriers of applying each distributed algorithm in practice are discussed. Since the applications of distributed algorithms in practical cases largely rely on the high performance computing (HPC) platform, the application of HPC techniques on power system operation problems is also reviewed.

We propose a control approach that adjusts time-of-day signaling plans based on a prediction of future traffic flow. The prediction algorithm identifies correlated, low rank structure in historical measurement data and predicts future traffic flow from real-time measurements by determining which structural trends are prominent in the measurements.

Given intermolecular hydrogen bond connection modes, we confirm that DMAPIP-2MeOH (two MeOH molecules connecting with DMAPIP system) is the most stable and reasonable form in both S0 and S1 states rather than DMAPIP-MeOH. Further, we make a new attribution that excited state multiple protons transfer (ESMPT) process can occur with a low potential barrier in the S1 state for DMAPIP-2MeOH, and rotation process of twisting dimethylamino or dimethylaminophenyl moiety is nonexistent. Our work not only clarifies how to judge numbers of solvent molecules participating in ESMPT reaction, but paves the way for further investigating intermolecular multiple hydrogen bonds interactions in biological field.",Zhao J.,2017-02-25,"Data science for energy systems: theory, techniques and prospect"
SCOPUS_ID:85003443591,"Due to the economic and environmental benefits, wind power is becoming one of the more promising supplements for electric power generation. However, the uncertainty exhibited in wind power data is generally unacceptably large. Thus, the data should be accurately evaluated by operators to effectively mitigate the risks of wind power on power system operations. Recognizing this challenge, a novel deep learning based ensemble approach is proposed for probabilistic wind power forecasting. In this approach, an advanced point forecasting method is originally proposed based on wavelet transform and convolutional neural network. Wavelet transform is used to decompose the raw wind power data into different frequencies. The nonlinear features in each frequency that are used to improve the forecast accuracy are later effectively learned by the convolutional neural network. The uncertainties in wind power data, i.e., the model misspecification and data noise, are separately identified thereafter. Consequently, the probabilistic distribution of wind power data can be statistically formulated. The proposed ensemble approach has been extensively assessed using real wind farm data from China, and the results demonstrate that the uncertainties in wind power data can be better learned using the proposed approach and that a competitive performance is obtained.",Wang H.-Z.,2017-02-15,Deep learning based ensemble approach for probabilistic wind power forecasting
SCOPUS_ID:85003935989,"This paper presents a comprehensive review of power management strategy (PMS) utilized in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) with an emphasis on model predictive control (MPC) based strategies for the first time. Research on MPC-based power management systems for HEVs has intensified recently due to its many inherent merits.

SCOPUS_ID:84994060685,"Drought forecasting using standardized metrics of rainfall is a core task in hydrology and water resources management. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is a rainfall-based metric that caters for different time-scales at which the drought occurs, and due to its standardization, is well-suited for forecasting drought at different periods in climatically diverse regions. This study advances drought modelling using multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), least square support vector machine (LSSVM), and M5Tree models by forecasting SPI in eastern Australia. MARS model incorporated rainfall as mandatory predictor with month (periodicity), Southern Oscillation Index, Pacific Decadal Oscillation Index and Indian Ocean Dipole, ENSO Modoki and Nino 3.0, 3.4 and 4.0 data added gradually. The performance was evaluated with root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (r
                     2). Best MARS model required different input combinations, where rainfall, sea surface temperature and periodicity were used for all stations, but ENSO Modoki and Pacific Decadal Oscillation indices were not required for Bathurst, Collarenebri and Yamba, and the Southern Oscillation Index was not required for Collarenebri. Inclusion of periodicity increased the r
                     2 value by 0.5–8.1% and reduced RMSE by 3.0–178.5%. Comparisons showed that MARS superseded the performance of the other counterparts for three out of five stations with lower MAE by 15.0–73.9% and 7.3–42.2%, respectively. For the other stations, M5Tree was better than MARS/LSSVM with lower MAE by 13.8–13.4% and 25.7–52.2%, respectively, and for Bathurst, LSSVM yielded more accurate result. For droughts identified by SPI≤−0.5, accurate forecasts were attained by MARS/M5Tree for Bathurst, Yamba and Peak Hill, whereas for Collarenebri and Barraba, M5Tree was better than LSSVM/MARS. Seasonal analysis revealed disparate results where MARS/M5Tree was better than LSSVM. The results highlight the importance of periodicity in drought forecasting and also ascertains that model accuracy scales with geographic/seasonal factors due to complexity of drought and its relationship with inputs and data attributes that can affect the evolution of drought events.",Deo R.C.,2017-02-01,"Drought forecasting in eastern Australia using multivariate adaptive regression spline, least square support vector machine and M5Tree model"

SCOPUS_ID:85007242133,"This paper seeks to provide some explanation as to how demand-, supply- and institutions-related factors in China have affected the creation and diffusion of Internet of Things (IoT)-related products and services. Concerning demand side factors the paper demonstrates how potential market size and existing technology trajectory work in favor of IoT diffusion. As a related demand side factor the paper argues that, in terms of the technological trajectory, China has started farther from the frontier than most industrialized countries. The degree of incremental benefit from the IoT is thus higher in the country. As to the supply side factors, the article promotes an understanding of how Chinese technology companies have capitalized on a huge user base to develop IoT-based applications. It also suggests that technologies and expertise provided by foreign multinationals have also played crucial roles. Regarding formal institutions, the government's proactive policies have been a major factor in the IoT's evolution. It is also in the Chinese government's interest to develop IoT products to make censorship and surveillance more effective. Regarding informal institutions, Chinese consumers are less concerned than Westerners about being tracked and monitored, which provides a favorable condition for the adoption of IoT-enabled devices. Nonetheless, this condition is changing due to increasing abuse of consumer privacy. China and the U.S. are compared in terms of diffusion, key determinants, performance indicators and impacts of the IoT in order to understand the areas that China outperforms—and underperforms—the U.S. Some indicators are proposed to gauge the IoT-related performance and the impacts of the IoT.",Kshetri N.,2017-02-01,"The evolution of the internet of things industry and market in China: An interplay of institutions, demands and supply"

SCOPUS_ID:85007110624,"Profit maximization focuses on maximizing the difference between the revenue and the cost. Two of major cost components in manufacturing are the electricity and labor costs. New electricity tariffs charge manufacturing firms based on time-of-use and critical-peak prices. Some recent research activities have been conducted under such a time-varying framework. However, these studies mainly focus on reducing the electricity cost by shifting production from the on-peak to the off-peak period, and it may not always be consistent with the ultimate goal of profit maximization. This is because employees in various manufacturing industries are entitled a shift differential in their wage profiles. Therefore, this paper addresses how to properly arrange production that leads to the best tradeoff under time-varying pricing of both costs. The production function, the electricity cost model, and the labor cost model are established to formulate the manufacturing profit maximization problem. The effects of the seasons, number of workers, buffer capacity, machine reliability, initial condition, and time-varying pricing on the final solutions are examined.",Wang Y.,2017-02-01,Manufacturing profit maximization under time-varying electricity and labor pricing
SCOPUS_ID:85002908099,"Many manufacturers today are striving to offer high value-added product-service systems (PSS) to their customers. Since the success of the PSS largely depends on the understanding and satisfying of different requirements, requirements management (RM) has become a critical factor in PSS development.

Thus, this research analyzes the state of the art of requirements management for PSS by reviewing extensive literature of requirement identification, analysis, specification, and forecast. Based on the review, key challenges and future research directions are identified, and they are requirement elicitation considering interactions, hybrid PSS conflict detection and resolution, dynamic requirement forecasting with big data, smart requirement management and proactive response.

SCOPUS_ID:85007079316,"In this study, a PCA-based cluster quantile regression (PCA-CQR) method was proposed through integrating principal component analysis and quantile regression approaches into a stepwise cluster analysis framework. In detail, the principal component analysis was adopted to overcome the multicollinearity among the explanatory variables, while the quantile regression approach was used to provide probabilistic information in prediction. The proposed PCA-CQR method can effectively capture discrete and nonlinear relationships between explanatory and response variables. The applicability of PCA-CQR was demonstrated by a case study of monthly streamflow prediction in the Xiangxi River, China. The nonlinearity between the hydro-meteorological variables and the streamflow measurements was characterized through the measure of maximal information coefficient (MIC), which demonstrated the need of the proposed PCA-CQR method. The results showed that the previous monthly streamflow and precipitation, as well as potential evapotranspiration in current month posed significant nonlinear impacts on the streamflow in current month. Three components could well reflect the total variance of the input variables. Comparison between traditional SCA and PCA-CQR showed that the proposed approach could provide more accurate predictions than traditional SCA methods. Moreover, probabilistic forecasts could be provided by PCA-CQR, and the 90% predictive intervals could well bracket the observations in both calibration and validation periods. Also, sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the impacts of the control parameters in PCA-CQR on the performance of the proposed model. The results showed the proposed PCA-CQR improved the robustness of traditional SCA. Finally, comparison among PCA-CQR, GRNN and MLR also showed the effectiveness of the proposed method.",Fan Y.R.,2017-02-01,"Development of PCA-based cluster quantile regression (PCA-CQR) framework for streamflow prediction: Application to the Xiangxi river watershed, China"

By performing DC and AC electrical characterization, we demonstrate that a careful engineering of the W oxidation conditions enables to boost the performance of these devices.

SCOPUS_ID:85000995908,"Burgeoning demand for additional energy sources to supplement existing fossil fuel supplies has increased the requirement for efficient and cost-effective renewable energy. Wind energy is among the most prominent renewable sources and wind turbine technology has seen growth in recent years. Urban-sited wind turbines are a significant feature of this growth, with small-scale and roof-mounted turbines receiving attention in the literature. A detailed analysis of the performance of a commercial-scale wind turbine operating in an urban environment is critically important for furthering understanding of the viability of this technology in a non-traditional environment. This study provides a performance characterisation of an 850kW-rated wind turbine situated on-campus at Dundalk Institute of Technology, Ireland, with measurements having been obtained over the course of one year. Characterisation of the wind conditions recorded at the wind turbine site has enabled development of a Weibull distribution model with shape and scale factors of 1.9151 and 6.9665 respectively. The power curve of the turbine in operation is presented for comparison with manufacturer specifications and utilised along with the wind speed data to calculate the wind turbine's annual energy output (AEO) for the year. Importantly, these findings can be used to assist with future wind energy developments in assessing the technical and economic viability using the approach outlined in this work.",Cooney C.,2017-02-01,"Performance characterisation of a commercial-scale wind turbine operating in an urban environment, using real data"

SCOPUS_ID:84992359991,"The circular economy (CE) aims to radically improve resource efficiency by eliminating the concept of waste and leading to a shift away from the linear take-make-waste model. In a CE, resources are flowing in a circular manner either in a biocycle (biomass) or technocycle (inorganic materials). While early studies indicate that 3D printing (3DP) holds substantial promise for sustainability and the creation of a CE, there is no guarantee that it will do so. There is great uncertainty regarding whether the current trajectory of 3DP adoption is creating more circular material flows or if it is leading to an alternative scenario in which less eco-efficient localised production, demands for customised goods, and a higher rate of product obsolescence combine to bring about increased resource consumption. It is critical that CE principles are embedded into the new manufacturing system before the adoption of 3DP reaches a critical inflection point in which negative practices become entrenched. This paper, authored by both academic and industry experts, proposes a research agenda to determine enablers and barriers for 3DP to achieve a CE. We explore the two following overarching questions to discover what specific issues they entail: (1) How can a more distributed manufacturing system based on 3DP create a circular economy of closed-loop material flows? (2) What are the barriers to a circular 3D printing economy? We specifically examine six areas—design, supply chains, information flows, entrepreneurship, business models and education—with the aim of formulating a research agenda to enable 3DP to reach its full potential for a CE.",Despeisse M.,2017-02-01,Unlocking value for a circular economy through 3D printing: A research agenda

The BooNN consist of combining a set of artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained iteratively. At each iteration, the error between the estimated output from the ANN model trained in the previous iteration and the target output is minimized. The final predicted result is the weighted sum of output from all the trained models. This process reduces the magnitude of forecasting errors and their variation compared to a single ANN and bagged neural networks (BNN). It further significantly lowers computational time compared to BNN. Results with real data further confirm that BooNN lead to improved load forecasting performance with respect to other existing techniques.",Khwaja A.S.,2017-02-01,Boosted neural networks for improved short-term electric load forecasting

The purpose of this paper is to develop a forecasting system for discarded end-of-life vehicles and to predict the number of end-of-life vehicles that will be generated in the future. To create the forecasting system, grey system theory, which uses a small amount of the most recent data, is employed. The accuracy of the grey model is improved with parameter optimization, Fourier series and Markov chain correction. The proposed models are applied to the case of Turkey and data sets of twelve regions in Turkey are considered.

SCOPUS_ID:84998698747,"Long-term time series forecasting is a challenging problem both in theory and in practice. Although the idea of information granulation has been shown to be an essential concept and algorithmic pursuit in time series prediction, there is still an acute need for developing a sound conceptual framework for time series prediction so that information granulation can capture the essence of collections of data better, including average and trend information. In this paper, a novel type of fuzzy information granule involving a time-dependent (non-stationary) membership function is proposed to structure numerical time series into granular time series. We show that the underlying arithmetic along with the concept of distance for this type of information granules can be expressed in a simple way, which facilitates the ensuing processing of information granules. With this regard, distances between observation granules and antecedent granules presented in fuzzy rules can be easily determined. The design of long-term prediction method based on fuzzy inference system is then realized through interpolation completed with the aid of fuzzy rules. Experiments involving chaotic Mackey–Glass time series and real-world time series demonstrate that the proposed model produces better long-term forecasting than some existing numeric models such as Autoregressive (AR) models, nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) neural networks, Support Vector Regression (SVR) and fuzzy inference systems involving triangular and interval information granules.",Yang X.,2017-02-01,Long-term forecasting of time series based on linear fuzzy information granules and fuzzy inference system

Using a dataset of 925 10b-5 securities class-action cases filed between 2002 and 2010, we show that the proposed hybrid model has the potential of computing better probabilities than either LR or NB models. By better, we mean lower root mean square errors of probabilities of dismissal. The proposed hybrid model uses the following features: allegations of generally accepted accounting principles violations, allegations of lack of internal control, bankruptcy filing during the class period, allegations of Section 11 violations of Securities Act of 1933, and short-term drop in stock price.

SCOPUS_ID:84994000394,"Energy consumption and indoor environment of buildings are proved to be largely influenced by the presence and behaviors of occupants. The uncertainty caused by occupant behaviors accounts for a significant discrepancy between the predicted and actual energy usage. In a real world, building system operations and control will be directly affected by occupant behavior, which may lead to over thirty percent waste against building's designed performance. Therefore, the capability to seamlessly integrate occupant behavior in energy simulation tools and building management systems in the future is clearly important to optimize building energy use while maintaining the same level of services. However, research has not reached the phase that occupant behaviors could be effectively modeled. Thus, the traditional schedule based approach is not adequate to satisfy the needs of building efficiency. In this paper, a thorough survey of occupant behavior modeling and simulation state-of-the-art technologies and methodologies for building energy efficiency is conducted. The paper first identifies and discusses the significance and application scale of building occupant behavior model. Based on the information collected, some recent data acquisition technologies for behavior-related research and occupant behavior modeling approaches are summarized.

In addition, compared with state-owned listed companies, the negative influence of oil price uncertainty on corporate investment is more significant for non-state-owned listed companies.

The results show that H2SO4 concentration, temperature, time, stirring speed, and particle size affect the conversion efficiency. Moreover, this work reveals that solid H2WO4 layer on the surface of CaWO4 particles forms and develops from thickness and looseness to thinness and denseness with increasing H2SO4 concentration, and thus hinders the conversion of CaWO4 to H2WO4, whereas CaSO4·nH2O almost does not deposit in the layer.

SCOPUS_ID:85028259895,"Electric utilities are under pressure to increase clean energy production. Although the adoption of renewable energy can improve the utilities' environmental performance, a fundamental question is if it also pays in economic terms. Building on the natural-resource-based view of the firm, we answer this question using two data analysis methods. First, we carry out a regression analysis of panel data from 66 large electric utilities covering the period 2005–2014, applying both a fixed and random effects estimator. Subsequently, we use the Granger causality test to explore possible causality links. Our results show a negative correlation at the firm level between renewable energy increase and short-term as well as long-term financial performance. More specifically, we find that an increase in renewable energy penetration Granger-causes a reduction of long-term performance. However, the results also show that a firm's carbon intensity moderates the relationship. When the focus is on the country level, we find that an increase in renewable power penetration is also negatively correlated to long-term firm performance, which might be explained by the combined effect of low power demand and overcapacity in developed economies. We conclude that the concept of organizational ambidexterity may supplement the natural-resource-based view of the firm for a better understanding of the relationship between an increase in renewable power and a firm's profitability.",Ruggiero S.,2017-01-20,Renewable energy growth and the financial performance of electric utilities: A panel data study

We have recently synthesized a series of Chondroitin sulfate/poly (d,l-lactideco-glycolide) block copolymers (Chs-b-PLGA) with different length of hydrophobic block by an end-to-end coupling strategy. The structure of the amphiphilic block copolymers with low critical micelle concentration (∼28mg/L) were confirmed by 1H NMR. The copolymers could self-assemble into stable micelles in aqueous environment with homogeneous size distribution and negative zeta potential. The hemolytic study indicated their excellent blood compatibility and potential application for intravenous administration. DOX can be efficiently encapsulated by the Chs-b-PLGA micelles. The DOX-loaded micelles showed a sustained and pH dependent drug release behavior. The cytotoxicity assay showed no associated toxicity with blank micelles while concentration-related cell inhibition with DOX-loaded micelles. Moreover, fast cellular uptake of DOX-loaded micelles was observed by fluorescent microscope. In vivo pharmacokinetics study showed that the Chs-b-PLGA micelles could significantly prolong the blood circulation time of DOX. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DOX-loaded micelles in Kunming mice was about 2-fold higher of the MTD of free DOX, indicating a high tolerance of the DOX-loaded micelles. In conclusion, the Chs-b-PLGA micelles would be a potentially useful drug delivery system for cancer therapy.",Zhang C.,2017-01-10,Photovoltaic power forecast based on neural network with a small number of samples

SCOPUS_ID:84991481630,"Structural decomposition analysis (SDA) has been a popular tool for studying a country's energy or emission performance. At the same time, there has been an increasing use of intensity indicators, such as energy consumption and carbon emissions per unit of economic output, in energy and emission performance reporting. The ratio change of an energy or emission intensity indicator can be more conveniently handled in the multiplicative form. In the context of multiplicative SDA of intensity indicators, this study investigates three specific methodological issues. The first is about sub-aggregate decomposition which provides detailed results at the sectoral/regional level to explain the observed aggregate intensity change. The second is the possible linkages between multiplicative SDA and additive SDA when studying changes in an intensity indicator over time. Arising from the convergence between SDA and index decomposition analysis (IDA) in application, the third issue is about the conceptual and empirical linkages between these two decomposition analysis techniques in the multiplicative form. A better understanding of these three issues will help to promote the use of multiplicative SDA of intensity indicators.

SCOPUS_ID:85028593063,"Heat demand forecasting is in one form or another an integrated part of most optimisation solutions for district heating and cooling (DHC). Since DHC systems are demand driven, the ability to forecast this behaviour becomes an important part of most overall energy efficiency efforts.
                  This paper presents the current status and results from extensive work in the development, implementation and operational service of online machine learning algorithms for demand forecasting. Recent results and experiences are compared to results predicted by previous work done by the authors. The prior work, based mainly on certain decision tree based regression algorithms, is expanded to include other forms of decision tree solutions as well as neural network based approaches. These algorithms are analysed both individually and combined in an ensemble solution. Furthermore, the paper also describes the practical implementation and commissioning of the system in two different operational settings where the data streams are analysed online in real-time.
                  It is shown that the results are in line with expectations based on prior work, and that the demand predictions have a robust behaviour within acceptable error margins.

This paper presents a review of different electricity load forecasting models with a particular focus on regression models, discussing different applications, most commonly used regression variables and methods to improve the performance and accuracy of the models. A comparison between the models is then presented for forecasting day ahead hourly electricity loads using real building and Campus data obtained from the Kensington Campus and Tyree Energy Technologies Building (TETB) at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). The results reveal that Artificial Neural Networks with Bayesian Regulation Backpropagation have the best overall root mean squared and mean absolute percentage error performance and almost all the models performed better predicting the overall Campus load than the single building load. The models were also tested on forecasting daily peak electricity demand. For each model, the obtained error for daily peak demand forecasts was higher than the average day ahead hourly forecasts.

The models predict the net load for horizons ranging from 10 to 30min. The forecasting methods implemented include hybrid methods based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), which are both coupled with image processing methods for sky images. These methods are compared against reference persistence methods. Three enhancement methods are implemented to further decrease forecasting error: (1) decomposing the time series of the net load to remove low-frequency load variation due to daily human activities; (2) segregating the model training between daytime and nighttime; and (3) incorporating sky image features as exogenous inputs in the daytime forecasts. The ANN and SVR models are trained and validated using six-month measurements of the net load and assessed using common statistic metrics: MBE, MAPE, rRMSE, and forecast skill, which is defined as the reduction of RMSE over the RMSE of reference persistence model. Results for the independent testing set show that data-driven models, with the enhancement methods, significantly outperform the reference persistence model, achieving forecasting skills (improvement over reference persistence model) as large as 43% depending on location, solar penetration and forecast horizons.",Chu Y.,2017-01-01,Net load forecasts for solar-integrated operational grid feeders
SCOPUS_ID:84994731834,"Managing intermittent demand is a vital task in several industrial contexts, and good forecasting ability is a fundamental prerequisite for an efficient inventory control system in stochastic environments. In recent years, research has been conducted on single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks, with promising results. In particular, back-propagation has been adopted as a gradient descent-based algorithm for training networks. However, when managing a large number of items, it is not feasible to optimize networks at item level, due to the effort required for tuning the parameters during the training stage. A simpler and faster learning algorithm, called the extreme learning machine, has been therefore proposed in the literature to address this issue, but it has never been tried for forecasting intermittent demand. On the one hand, an extensive comparison of single-hidden layer networks trained by back-propagation is required to improve our understanding of them as predictors of intermittent demand. On the other hand, it is also worth testing extreme learning machines in this context, because of their lower computational complexity and good generalisation ability.
                  In this paper, neural networks trained by back-propagation and extreme learning machines are compared with benchmark neural networks, as well as standard forecasting methods for intermittent demand on real-time series, by combining different input patterns and architectures. A statistical analysis is then conducted to validate the best performance through different aggregation levels. Finally, some insights for practitioners are presented to improve the potential of neural networks for implementation in real environments.",Lolli F.,2017-01-01,Single-hidden layer neural networks for forecasting intermittent demand
SCOPUS_ID:85016032202,"Reliable and highly-generalized prediction models of short-term electric demand are urgently needed for the building sector, as the crucial basis of sophisticated building energy management. Advances in metering technologies and machine learning methods provide both opportunities and challenges for modified approaches. With multi-resolution wavelet decomposition (MWD) as a preprocessing from the point of view of signal analysis, the hybrid support vector regression (SVR) model was applied in two case study buildings to predict the hourly electric demand intensity. Taking ten-dimensional parameters of 29 workdays as the training sample, this model was carried out in a mall and a hotel, the consumed electric demand sequences of which represented the stationary and non-stationary series respectively.
                  By comparisons between the hybrid SVR and the pure SVR, results indicated that the introduction of MWD can always improve the predicting accuracy for the hotel, while it is not necessary for the mall. Specifically, the similar steady level around 0.65W/m2 of absolute error was obtained for the mall and the hotel buildings, when ε was lower than 0.1. At the same time, the steady quantitative values of relative errors tended to be around 4% and 6% respectively for the hotel and the mall. Based on the limited historical readings, this paper offers an on-line prediction method of short-term electric demand, which is applicable for the further smart energy management.",Chen Y.,2017-01-01,Short-term prediction of electric demand in building sector via hybrid support vector regression

SCOPUS_ID:85014012199,"Demand management in residential buildings is a key component toward sustainability and efficiency in urban environments. The recent advancements in sensor based technologies hold the promise of novel energy consumption models that can better characterize the underlying patterns.
                  In this paper, we propose a probabilistic data-driven predictive model for consumption forecasting in residential buildings. The model is based on Bayesian network (BN) framework which is able to discover dependency relations between contributing variables. Thus, we can relax the assumptions that are often made in traditional forecasting models. Moreover, we are able to efficiently capture the uncertainties in input variables and quantify their effect on the system output. We test our proposed approach to the data provided by Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL) which has been collected through a pilot Smart Grid project.
                  We examine the performance of our model in a multiscale setting by considering various temporal (i.e., 15min, hourly intervals) and spatial (i.e., all households in a region, each household) resolutions for analyzing data. Demand forecasting at the individual households’ levels is a first step toward designing personalized and targeted policies for each customer. While this is a widely studied topic in digital marketing, few researches have been done in the energy sector.

SCOPUS_ID:85008315464,"Electricity prices have rather complex features such as high volatility, high frequency, nonlinearity, mean reversion and non-stationarity that make forecasting very difficult. However, accurate electricity price forecasting is essential to market traders, retailers, and generation companies. To improve prediction accuracy using each model’s unique features, this paper proposes a hybrid approach that combines the wavelet transform, the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) based on self-adapting particle swarm optimization and an auto regressive moving average (ARMA). Self-adaptive particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) is adopted to search for the optimal kernel parameters of the KELM. After testing the wavelet decomposition components, stationary series as new input sets are predicted by the ARMA model and non-stationary series are predicted by the SAPSO-KELM model. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by using electricity price data from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM), Australian and Spanish markets.

SCOPUS_ID:85028596391,"Utilities consider having accurate electric load forecasts to be critical to their day-to-day operations. But the growing penetration of distributed photovoltaic (DPV) solar power production “behind the meter” makes it more difficult to predict load because it is hard to distinguish between increased solar power generation and decreased power consumption at a site with installed DPV. This paper describes the development of a “top down” solar power forecasting system and how it can be integrated with a load forecasting system that incorporates weather information. Both systems depend on accurate weather forecasts, information regarding the utility variables, and daily and seasonal factors. The load forecasting system provides day-ahead forecasts having roughly 2% error, on average, and the solar power forecast is within 5% error. In general, we find that if the load forecasting system incorporates the same weather and solar predictors as the solar power forecasting system, it implicitly accounts for DPV generation during periods of stationary solar power deployment, and a separate DPV forecast may not be necessary. However, for higher penetrations of solar power during times of rapid deployment of additional solar capacity, it may become important to explicitly incorporate the solar power forecasts to avoid degradation of the load forecasts. This approach could allow utilities and independent system operators to better deal with rapidly increasing penetration of DPV generation.",Haupt S.E.,2017-01-01,Blending distributed photovoltaic and demand load forecasts

Using these metrics, the ELM model’s performance was compared to that of existing methods: multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), M5 Model Tree, and a semi-empirical (Pro6UV) clear sky model. Based on RMSE and MAE values, the ELM model (0.255, 0.346, respectively) outperformed the MARS (0.310, 0.438) and M5 Model Tree (0.346, 0.466) models. Concurring with these metrics, the Willmott’s Index for the ELM, MARS and M5 Model Tree models were 0.966, 0.942 and 0.934, respectively. About 57% of the ELM model’s absolute errors were small in magnitude (±0.25), whereas the MARS and M5 Model Tree models generated 53% and 48% of such errors, respectively, indicating the latter models’ errors to be distributed in larger magnitude error range. In terms of peak global UVI forecasting, with half the level of error, the ELM model outperformed MARS and M5 Model Tree. A comparison of the magnitude of hourly-cumulated errors of 10-min lead time forecasts for diffuse and global UVI highlighted ELM model’s greater accuracy compared to MARS, M5 Model Tree or Pro6UV models.

SCOPUS_ID:84988524929,"Short-term load forecasting is essential for reliable and economic operation of power systems. Short-term forecasting covers a range of predictions from a fraction of an hour-ahead to a day-ahead forecasting. An accurate load forecast results in establishing appropriate operational practices and bidding strategies, as well as scheduling adequate energy transactions. This paper presents a generalized technique for modeling historical load data in the form of time-series with different cycles of seasonality (e.g., daily, weekly, quarterly, annually) in a given power network. The proposed method separately models both non-seasonal and seasonal cycles of the load data using auto-regressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) components, which only rely on historical load data without requiring any additional inputs such as historical weather data (which might not be available in most cases). The accuracy of data modeling is examined using the Akaike/Bayesian information criteria (AIC/BIC) which are two effective quantification methods for evaluation of data forecasting. In order to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed forecaster, we use the hourly-metered load data of PJM network as a real-world input dataset.",Boroojeni K.G.,2017-01-01,A novel multi-time-scale modeling for electric power demand forecasting: From short-term to medium-term horizon

Radial mycelial growth and sporulation of QoI-resistant and -sensitive C. sojina isolates were compared in the laboratory, and virulence of QoI-resistant and -sensitive isolates on a susceptible soybean cultivar (Blackhawk) and on a cultivar (Davis) with the Rcs3 resistance gene that confers resistance to frogeye leaf spot were compared. No differences in amount of sporulation between QoI-resistant and -sensitive isolates were observed. On cultivar (cv.) Blackhawk, frogeye leaf spot caused by QoI-resistant isolates was more severe than disease caused by QoI-sensitive isolates 7–8 days after inoculation, but no differences in disease between QoI-resistant and -sensitive isolates were observed 9 days after inoculation. On cv. Davis, QoI-resistant isolates caused significantly greater disease severity than sensitive isolates 8–14 days after inoculation. Although cv. Davis was affected more severely by QoI-resistant isolates, disease severity was less on cv. Davis than cv. Blackhawk, indicating that the Rcs3 gene was still effective against the C. sojina isolates tested.

Conventional methods, which heavily rely on physical principles, have limited power in practice as their performance is subject to many physical assumptions. By contrast, data-driven methods have gained huge interests due to their flexibility in model development and the rich data available in modern buildings. The rapid development in data science has provided advanced data analytics to tackle prediction problems in a more convenient, efficient and effective way.
                  This paper investigates the potential of one of the most promising techniques in advanced data analytics, i.e., deep learning, in predicting 24-h ahead building cooling load profiles. Deep learning refers to a collection of machine learning algorithms which are powerful in revealing nonlinear and complex patterns in big data. Deep learning can be used either in a supervised manner to develop prediction models with given inputs and output (i.e., cooling load), or in an unsupervised manner to extract meaningful features from raw data as model inputs. This study exploits the potential of deep learning in both manners, and compares its performance in cooling load prediction with typical feature extraction methods and popular prediction techniques in the building field. The results show that deep learning can enhance the performance of building cooling load prediction, especially when used in an unsupervised manner for constructing high-level features as model inputs. Using the features extracted by unsupervised deep learning as inputs for cooling load prediction can evidently enhance the prediction performance. The findings are enlightening and could bring more flexible and effective solutions for building energy predictions.",Fan C.,2017-01-01,A short-term building cooling load prediction method using deep learning algorithms

Herein a bioorthogonal-activated prodrug has been developed for bioimaging and therapy, which is composed of a Pd-mediated cleavable propargyl, a coumarin fluorophore and a potent anticancer drug. In vitro investigations show that, the presence of a Pd complex induces the cleavage of propargyl and subsequently trigger the cascade of reactions, thereby activating the coumarin fluorophore for imaging and releasing the anticancer drug for therapy. Both the prodrug and Pd complex were then separately encapsulated into phospholipid liposomes to form a two-component bioorthogonal nanosystem. The lyposomal nanosystem can be readily internalized by HeLa cells and displays strong intracellular fluorescence under one- or two-photon excitation, indicating the release of the active drug in cells as a result of the Pd-mediated bioorthogonal bond-cleavage reaction. More importantly, the nanosystem shows considerable high activity and exerts efficient inhibition towards tumor growth in a mouse model.

Thus, forecasting is becoming an important tool for system grid operators to manage solar photovoltaic (PV) energy production and satisfy the demand of energy consumers. This work aims to develop a forecasting model for solar irradiance that can be used in calculating next-day energy generation of solar PV systems.

So, short term load forecast (STLF) has been proposed by researchers to tackle the mentioned problem. Not merely has it been researched extensively and intensively, but also a variety of forecasting methods has been raised. This paper outlines a new prediction model for small scale load prediction i.e., buildings or sites. The proposed model is based on improved version of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) which is called sliding window EMD (SWEMD), a new feature selection algorithm and hybrid forecast engine. The aims of proposed feature selection algorithm is to maximize the relevancy and minimize the redundancy criterion based on Pearson's correlation (MRMRPC) coefficient. Finally, an improved Elman neural network (IENN) based forecast engine proposed to predict the load signal in this procedure.

This paper is to seek a hybrid method to improve the accuracy and reliability of scale-forecast and obtain the optimal hierarchical structure of highway network in Hangzhou in the Year 2015, 2020 and 2025. Firstly, drawbacks of traditional scale-forecast methods of highway network and advantages of the combinative forecast method which embraces BP neural network (BPNN) and Markov chain are illustrated. Then, a novel prediction method which is based on BPNN and Markov chain with the consideration of five elements, including GDP, total population, the number of civil motor vehicle ownership, passenger capacity and volume of freight traffic is proposed. After that, a multi-objective programming (MOP) model is established to obtain the optimum technical grade structure of highway network. Thirdly, with the Program for the 13th Five-Year Development Plan of Highway Transportation in Hangzhou, the scale of highway and its optimal hierarchical structure in the year of 2015, 2020 and 2025 is obtained.

SCOPUS_ID:85026542109,"The expansion of fluctuating renewable electricity sources creates new challenges for grid operators. One often suggested solution is demand-side response (DR): the adaptation of electricity consumption to generation. Here, we investigate what role DR could play to support system stability through fully remote-controlled (by the grid operator) shifts of individual processes in households and in the commercial and industrial sectors, testing the case of a high-renewables future in Germany. The grid operator is constrained by consumer acceptance of service interruptions, both in size and shift duration, and by technical boundaries. We find that DR has a large potential and is suited for short-term services such as spinning reserve or primary control and for damping residual load gradients. However, its potential is low for longer-term services like secondary/tertiary control or for satisfying residual load during low sun/wind times in a high-renewables future. We find that the potential for DR is not limited by the magnitude of shiftable capacity but by the maximum shift duration and the patterns of switching between positive and negative power demand, which makes DR useful for fast and short-term services but less useful for longer shifts.",Aryandoust A.,2017-01-01,The potential and usefulness of demand response to provide electricity system services

This work proposes applying support vector regression, as one of the currently better machine learning options for short-term water demand forecasting, to build a base prediction.

This addition produces a tool able to eliminate many of the errors and much of the bias inherent in a fixed regression structure when responding to new incoming time series data.

The summer period is selected to target cooling requirements that are generally directly associated with electricity use compared with winter heating requirements that are derived from a mix of energy sources that has changed over time. Historical monthly electricity consumption data from 1990 to 2013 are used to build a predictive model with a set of corresponding climate and non-climate covariates. A clustering analysis was performed first to identify groups of states that had similar temporal patterns for the cooling-degree-days of each state. Then, a partial pooling model is applied to each cluster to assess the sensitivity of monthly per capita residential electricity demand to each predictor (these are cooling-degree-days, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, per capita electricity demand from the previous month and previous year, and the residential electricity price). Most of the predictors are significant for most of the states across USA. The sensitivity of residential electricity demand to cooling-degree-days has an identifiable geographic distribution with a stronger relationship in northeastern United States. This predictive model considers interactions between causal factors at large spatial scales and quantifies the model uncertainty.

The turbidity forecasting methodology developed here is completely data-driven and does not require hydraulic or water quality network model that is expensive to build and maintain. The methodology is tested and verified on a real trunk main network with observed turbidity measurement data. Results obtained show that the methodology can detect if discolouration material is mobilised, estimate if sufficient turbidity will be generated to exceed a preselected threshold and approximate how long the material will take to reach the downstream meter. Classification based forecasts of turbidity can be reliably made up to 5 h ahead although at the expense of increased false alarm rates.

To realize this potential, a coordination among multiple microgrids is needed. In this context, this paper presents a new distributed economic model predictive control scheme for the coordinated stochastic energy management of multi-microgrids. By optimally coordinating the operation of individual microgrids, this scheme maintains the system-wide supply and demand balance in an economical manner. Based on the probabilistic forecasts of renewable power generation and microgrid load, this scheme effectively handles the uncertainties in both supply and demand. Using the Chebyshev inequality and the Delta method, the corresponding stochastic optimization problems have been converted to quadratic and linear programs. The proposed scheme is evaluated on a large-scale case that includes ten interconnected microgrids. The results indicated that the proposed scheme successfully reduces the system wide operating cost, achieves the supply-demand balance in each microgrid, and brings the energy exchange between DNO and main grid to a predefined trajectory.",Kou P.,2017-01-01,Distributed EMPC of multiple microgrids for coordinated stochastic energy management

In recent years, machine learning approaches are being widely used for the prediction of wave heights. However, these approaches involve batch learning algorithms that are not well-equipped to address the demands of continuously changing data stream. In this paper, we conduct a study to predict the daily wave heights in different geographical regions using sequential learning algorithms, namely the Minimal Resource Allocation Network (MRAN) and the Growing and Pruning Radial Basis Function (GAP-RBF) network. The study is conducted using data collected from 13 stations across three geographically distinct regions, viz., the Gulf of Mexico, the Korean region and the UK region, for the period between Jan 1, 2011 and Aug 30, 2015. The data is chosen such that the study covers a wide range of geographical terrains and locations, a wide range of wind speed and wave heights. We compare the performance of MRAN and GAP-RBF with Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The performance study results show that the MRAN and GAP-RBF outperform the SVR and ELM with minimal network resources, in the daily wave height prediction.

The real-time scheduling of generating units will become a very complex task with respect to the instantaneous fluctuation of the load demand due to several demand response scenarios in the smart grid context. In this study, a hybrid mathematical method for the online scheduling of units based on the least square support vector machine (LSSVM) and the third version of cultural algorithm (CA3) has been presented, where the CA3 has been specifically employed to tune the adjusting parameters of LSSVM. For the training purpose of the proposed method, the optimal scheduling of the daily load curve for four different test systems and various physical and environmental constraints of generating units have been prepared by using a modified mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) to deal with non-convex behaviors of the test systems. A mean squared error (MSE) objective function has been used to reduce the prediction errors during the training process to enhance the precision and reliability of the results. A radial basis function (RBF) and the proposed LSSVM-CA3 were used to check the convergence process.

For addressing this challenge, many researchers are committed to investigating highly accurate forecasting models, and feature selection (FS) technologies are considered as a powerful tool to improve performance of models in many literature. However, common FS technologies applied for Short-term load forecasting (STLF) ignore to select date information of the observed series as feature candidates and pay less attention to reduction rates of feature candidates, which will result in loss of date information and redundancy of features. Both drawbacks provide a significant roadblock for improving forecasting accuracy. Aiming to overcome both drawbacks and develop an effective model for STLF, this paper successfully investigates the date-framework strategy (DFS) to construct the pool of features and develops an FS technology, genetic algorithm binary improved cuckoo search (GABICS), to search a solution with the lowest reduction rate. Assigning the extreme learning machine (ELM) to be the forecast, GABICS-DFS-ELM not only obtains a minimum and effective subset of features but also has a satisfactory forecasting result with high accuracy and robustness.",Jiang P.,2017-01-01,A hybrid forecasting model based on date-framework strategy and improved feature selection technology for short-term load forecasting

SCOPUS_ID:85021221784,"“Solar photovoltaic (PV) energy in GCC”- the term seems convincing to many solar PV industries due to high solar exposure in GCC region. However, long-term effects such as dust accumulation and seasonal variation are major drawbacks for solar PV energy. This research aims to investigate PV performance for two years in the harsh environment of Qatar. For data collection, a wireless system has been developed to record critical parameters such as solar irradiance, relative humidity, ambient temperature, PV module temperature, dust, wind speed, and output PV power. Results show that due to panel dusting for eight months, the PV output power decreased by 50%. Also, owing to lower ambient temperatures, clearer sky and cleaner panels due to occasional rainfall, the PV panels show higher output power in Winter than in Summer season. Besides, within one-month, a cloudy condition in Winter causes 20% drop in average output power. Therefore, a strategic plan is needed to build and manage efficiently a PV solar plant in harsh environments such as of Qatar. Energy management requires prediction of energy yield. To this end, using machine-learning, a mathematical model has been established which can predict the output power from PV panels under different environmental conditions.",Touati F.,2017-01-01,Long-term performance analysis and power prediction of PV technology in the State of Qatar

SCOPUS_ID:85011659712,"Technology learning rates can be dynamic quantities as a technology moves from early development to piloting and from low volume manufacturing to high volume manufacturing. This work describes a generalizable technology analysis approach for disaggregating observed technology cost reductions and presents results of this approach for one specific case study (micro-combined heat and power fuel cell systems in Japan). We build upon earlier reports that combine discussion of fuel cell experience curves and qualitative discussion of cost components by providing greater detail on the contributing mechanisms to observed cost reductions, which were not quantified in earlier reports. Greater standardization is added to the analysis approach, which can be applied to other technologies. This paper thus provides a key linkage that has been missing from earlier literature on energy-related technologies by integrating the output of earlier manufacturing cost studies with observed learning rates to quantitatively estimate the different components of cost reduction including economies of scale and cost reductions due to product performance and product design improvements. This work also provides updated fuel cell technology price versus volume trends from the California Self-Generation Incentive Program, including extensive data for solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC) reported here for the first time. The Japanese micro-CHP market is found to have a learning rate of 18% from 2005 to 2015, while larger SOFC fuel cell systems (200kW and above) in the California market are found to have a flat (near-zero) learning rate, and these are attributed to a combination of exogenous, market, and policy factors.",Wei M.,2017-01-01,Experience curve development and cost reduction disaggregation for fuel cell markets in Japan and the US

SCOPUS_ID:85025468618,"A series of Ce modified TiO2 supported Co-Mn catalysts (CoxMn5/TiCey) prepared by sol-gel method and impregnation method were evaluated for simultaneous catalytic oxidation of Hg0 and NO in the simulated flue gas. Results showed that the catalysts exhibited good capacity of simultaneous catalytic oxidation of Hg0 (around 70%) and NO (around 40%) at 300°C using a simulated flue gas (Hg0, NO, SO2, O2, H2O and balanced N2). These catalysts were investigated in detail by means of N2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, TEM and XPS. The characterization results indicated that physical characteristics of catalysts were not the main contributor for Hg0 and NO oxidation. Ce species existed mainly in amorphous phase. The addition of CeOx might lead to a migration of Co and Mn species from bulk to surface. The addition of Co could promote the generation of Mn2O3 but obstruct the dispersion of MnOx on the surface of catalyst. An appropriate increasing loading amount of CoOx or CeOx would be preferable for the improvement of activity performance. The presence of Co3+/Co2+, Mn4+/Mn3+ and Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couples as well as surface oxygen species contributed to the Hg0 and NO oxidation. A possible synergetic effect Among Co, Mn and Ce species might improve the activity further. Furthermore, an increased oxygen concentration could facilitate the Hg0 and NO oxidation. NO was observed to promote Hg0 oxidation with the presence of O2. SO2 led to a certain decrease of Hg0 oxidation efficiency due to the competitive adsorption·H2O had a slightly inhibitory impact on Hg0 oxidation. Moreover, NO oxidation was more susceptible to SO2 than Hg0 oxidation over the catalyst.",Li H.,2017-01-01,A comprehensive learning-based model for power load forecasting in smart grid
SCOPUS_ID:85021642386,"To plan a distribution grid involves making a long-term forecast of sub-hourly demand, which requires modeling the demand and its dynamics with aggregated measurement data. Distribution system operators (DSOs) have been recording electricity sub-hourly demand delivered by their medium-voltage feeders (around 1000—10,000 customers) for several years. Demand profiles differ widely among the various considered feeders. This is partly due to the varying mix of customer categories from one feeder to another. To overcome this issue, elementary demand profiles are often associated with customer categories and then combined according to a mix description. This paper presents a novel method to estimate elementary profiles that only requires several feeder demand curves and a description of customers. The method relies on a statistical blind source model and a new estimation procedure based on the augmented Lagrangian method. The use of feeders to estimate elementary profiles means that measurements are fully representative and continuously updated. We illustrate the proposed method through a case study comprising around 1000 feeder demand curves operated by the main French DSO Enedis. We propose an application o that uses the obtained profiles to evaluate the contribution of any set of new customers to a feeder peak load. We show that profiles enable a simulation of new unmeasured areas with errors of around 20%. We also show how our method can be used to evaluate the relevancy of different customer categorizations.",Gerossier A.,2017-01-01,A novel method for decomposing electricity feeder load into elementary profiles from customer information

SCOPUS_ID:85029810700,"Literature is rich in methodologies for “aggregated” load forecasting which has helped electricity network operators and retailers in optimal planning and scheduling. The recent increase in the uptake of distributed generation and storage systems has generated new demand for “disaggregated” load forecasting for a single-customer or even down at an appliance level. Access to high resolution data from smart meters has enabled the research community to assess conventional load forecasting techniques and develop new forecasting strategies suitable for demand-side disaggregated loads.
                  This paper studies how calendar effects, forecasting granularity and the length of the training set affect the accuracy of a day-ahead load forecast for residential customers. Root mean square error (RMSE) and normalized RMSE were used as forecast error metrics. Regression trees, neural networks, and support vector regression yielded similar average RMSE results, but statistical analysis showed that regression trees technique is significantly better.
                  The use of historical load profiles with daily and weekly seasonality, combined with weather data, leaves the explicit calendar effects a very low predictive power. In the setting studied here, it was shown that forecast errors can be reduced by using a coarser forecast granularity. It was also found that one year of historical data is sufficient to develop a load forecast model for residential customers as a further increase in training dataset has a marginal benefit.",Lusis P.,2017-01-01,Short-term residential load forecasting: Impact of calendar effects and forecast granularity

SCOPUS_ID:85025660292,"Accurate wind speed prediction is a significant factor in improving and optimizing wind power production. Particularly, reliable short-term wind speed forecasting contributes to the real-time optimization of wind farm operation. However, this short-term forecasting task remains challenging due to the strong stochastic nature and dynamic uncertainty of wind speed. This paper proposes a hybrid model that consists of the Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT), Expectation Propagation (EP) algorithm and Gaussian process regression with the Student-t Observation Model (GPR-t) for short-term wind speed forecasting. The proposed approach firstly extracts meaningful information from a short-term wind speed series and subsequently models the inherent uncertainty and the dynamic features of the wind speed time-series. Additionally, the wind speed series presents a time-varying characteristic. Thus, this study adopts a moving window approach in the prediction processes, thereby permitting the proposed model to respond quickly to the dynamic characteristic of wind speed. To examine the forecasting performance of the suggested hybrid model, the validation of the proposed model is performed against several other existing models with half-hour and hourly wind speed data obtained from a windmill farm located in northwestern China. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid approach generates satisfactory point predictive accuracy and interval forecasting performance.",Hu J.,2017-01-01,A hybrid approach based on the Gaussian process with t-observation model for short-term wind speed forecasts

In this paper, we are tackling the problem of predicting total sales in order to print the right amount of books and doing so even before the book has reached the stores. A real dataset including the complete sales data for books published in Spain across several years has been used.

Consequently, this paper proposes and attempts to develop a conceptual framework with the potential to aid an international political transition towards a ‘post-capitalist’ ‘post-nation state’ global world. This conceptual framework is grounded within sociotechnological theory of the ‘Global Brain’ (GB), which describes a potential future planetary organizational structure founded on distributed and open-ended intelligence; and the socioeconomic theory of the ‘Commons’, which is a paradigm describing distributed modes of organization founded upon principles of democratic management and open access. In the integration of GB theory and Commons theory this paper ultimately argues that an appropriate international response to the emerging technological revolution should include the creation of networks with both automated and collaborative components that function on ‘Global Commons’ (GC) logic (i.e. beyond both state and market logic).",Last C.,2017-01-01,Global Commons in the Global Brain
SCOPUS_ID:85028586908,"This paper describes the progress of the Horizon 2020 STORM–project, started in March 2015. The objective of this project is to develop and demonstrate a generic district heating and cooling network controller. Generic in this sense means that the controller is applicable to widely spread 3rd generation, but also very innovative 4th generation networks. Therefore, the controller will be tested in a traditional district heating scheme but also in an advanced low-temperature network.
                  The controller influences the demand of the network to achieve a certain objective. STORM focuses on three objectives: (i) a peak shaving objective used to minimize the use of often polluting peak boilers; (ii) a cell balancing objective striving to balance a cluster of consumers to producers of excess heat or/cold; and (iii) a market interaction objective, applicable for heat/cold producers with a connection to the electrical grid (heat pumps or CHPs), maximizing the profit for the producer by switching these devices based on the electricity price.
                  To guarantee the generic applicability of the controller, self-learning control techniques are used. These techniques have the advantage that they ‘learn’ the behavior of the network by themselves without the need to be extensively tuned at the installation (plug-and-play installation).
                  To date, the focus was on algorithms for a forecast module of the heat/cold consumption of the network. These algorithms are already implemented in the controller platform and were running in real-time in one of the demonstration sites. Also, a tracking module was already developed and is currently tested. This module which will try to match the actual network consumption to this optimal consumption profile by distributing the control signals to the right heat consumers. Next step is the implementation of a planning module, which determines the optimal consumption profile, taken into account the forecasts.",Vanhoudt D.,2017-01-01,Status of the Horizon 2020 Storm Project

The case study building is representative of most of the buildings of the tertiary sector (e.g. offices and schools) built in Italy in the 60s–70s of the 20th century. The considered building models are: three lumped element grey-box models of first, second and third order, an AutoRegressive model with eXogenous inputs (ARX) and a Nonlinear AutoRegressive network with eXogenous inputs (NARX). The models identification is performed by means of real measured data. Nevertheless the quantity and quality of the available input data, all the data driven models show good accuracy in predicting short-term behaviour of the real building both in winter and summer. Among the grey-box models, the third order one shows the best performance with a Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) in winter less than 0.5°C for a prediction horizon of 1h and a RMSE less than 1°C for a prediction horizon of 3h. The ARX model shows a maximum RMSE less than 0.5°C for a prediction horizon of 1h and a RMSE less than 0.8°C for a prediction horizon of 3h. The NARX network shows a maximum RMSE less than 0.5°C for a prediction horizon of 1h and a RMSE less than 0.9°C for a prediction horizon of 3h. In summer the RMSE is always lower than 0.4°C for all the models with a 3-h prediction horizon. Other than typical control applications, the paper demonstrates that all the data driven models investigated can also be proposed as a powerful tool to detect some typologies of occupant bad behaviours and to predict the short-term flexibility of the building for demand response (DR) applications since they allow a good estimation of the building “thermal flywheel”.",Ferracuti F.,2017-01-01,Data-driven models for short-term thermal behaviour prediction in real buildings
SCOPUS_ID:85009350778,"Wind speed forecasting is a crucial issue in the wind power industry. However, the disadvantage of the existing wind speed forecasting models is that they often ignore similar fluctuation information between the adjacent WTGs (wind turbine generators), which leads to poor forecasting accuracy. This paper proposes a hybrid wind speed forecasting model to overcome this disadvantage. Specifically, grey correlation analysis is applied to select useful fluctuation information from the adjacent and observed WTGs, and the chosen fluctuation information is fed into the v-SVM (v-support vector machine), which offers good capability in nonlinear fitting, to perform wind speed forecasting of the observed WTGs. Meanwhile, to reduce the impacts of the model parameters on the final forecasting performance, CS (cuckoo search) is used to tune the parameters in the v-SVM. The results from two case studies show that the proposed model, which considers the fluctuation information of the adjacent WTG, offers greater accuracy than the other compared models. As concluded from the results of three accuracy tests, the performances of v-SVM and ε-SVM (ε-support vector machine) show no significant difference, and the CS algorithm is more efficient than the PSO (particle swarm optimization) for tuning of the parameters in the v-SVM.",Jiang P.,2017-01-01,Short-term wind speed forecasting using a hybrid model
SCOPUS_ID:85017169988,"Wind energy is considered as one of the most promising and economical renewable energy. In order to insure maximum yield of wind energy, it is vital to evaluate wind energy potential of the wind farms. Since wind energy is proportional to the cube of wind speed, the evaluation of wind energy potential assessment comes down to the wind speed forecasting. In this paper, the wind speed is predicted by utilizing a new dynamic integrated approach. The novelties of this method mainly include: firstly, the Phase Space Reconstruction (PSR) is employed to dynamically choose the input vectors of the forecasting model; secondly, the data preprocessing approach, named the Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA), is proposed to efficiently extract the nonlinear characteristics of the high-dimensional feature space reconstructed by the PSR; thirdly, Core Vector Regression (CVR) model, whose parameters are determined by the Competition Over Resource (COR) heuristic algorithm, is adopted to the model for quick computational speed; finally, the Grey Relational Analysis, Diebold-Mariano and Pesaran-Timmermann statistic are treated as evaluation tools to assess the forecasting effectiveness of this approach.

The severity of EV71 infection was classified as follows: Stage 1, hand–foot–mouth disease or herpangina; Stage 2, meningitis or myoclonic jerk; Stage 3A, encephalitis; Stage 3B, cardiopulmonary failure. Stages 2 to 3B were defined as severe EV71 infection. Children with Stages 3A and 3B infection were designated as the critical group.
               
               
                  Results
                  A total of 399 patients had laboratory-confirmed EV71 infection. Three risks factors were associated with the different degrees of severity in EV71 infection. Children <2 years old had much greater risks for severe EV71 infection [odds ratio (OR) 1.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2–2.8], delayed medical evaluation for critical infection (OR 9.4; 95% CI, 3.6–24.1), and developmental retardation for cardiopulmonary failure (OR 8.3; 95% CI, 2.0–33.7). Among all the habits and household factors, caregivers in the critical group had a significantly lower rate in terms of cleaning the faucet after washing their hands (OR 2.63; 95% CI, 1.14–6.08).
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  Children <2 years old, developmental retardation, and delayed medical intervention were associated with severe EV71 infection.

SCOPUS_ID:85024372380,"Distributed energy system (DES) has successfully aroused increasing interests among energy policy makers and system designers, as its potential of replacing conventional energy system. The optimal modeling of district load forecasting is essential to guarantee the best design and operation of DES. This paper presents a comprehensive review of district load forecasting (DLF) models to support the application of DES. The main factors affecting district load are discussed from inside to outside, including building indoor condition, building design characteristics, district layout, local microclimate, and social & economic factors. Through classifying and comparing top-down and bottom-up methods in terms of their key features and applications, it is found that the existing methods are either lack of forecasting accuracy or burdened with forecasting workload. Previous literatures reviewed in this paper show that the hybrid forecasting models including scenario analysis, physical-statistical numerical simulation and least square support vector machine based intelligent approaches have a superior ability to balance these two contradictions under different conditions. Based on the comparison results and current trend, a framework of district load forecasting, as well as corresponding future research work, is proposed for DES planning, design and service.",Ma W.,2017-01-01,Modeling of district load forecasting for distributed energy system

Considering the smart community has plenty of distributed generations, here, a concept of net load is defined as the active power difference between renewable generations (wind and PV power) and loads. Then, a combined forecasting approach, which enables to build a real-time forecasting model with parameters self-adjustment, is proposed for the forecasting of the net load in smart community. Compared with the traditional forecasting methods such as support vector machine (SVM), the proposed approach can wavily optimize the parameters of the forecasting model. Besides, an optimal method named Grid-GA searching is developed to reduce the computation time during the forecasting. Therefore, it can improve the forecasting accuracy even if there is a great of uncertainty component in wind power, PV generation and loads. Detailed case studies give a contrastive analysis of the traditional and the proposed forecasting approach. The results show that the proposed approach has the capability of self-adaption on the fluctuations of wind and PV power, and can effectively improve the forecasting accuracy and efficiency.",Li Y.,2017-01-01,A combined forecasting approach with model self-adjustment for renewable generations and energy loads in smart community
SCOPUS_ID:85029786041,"Bioenergy sources have been introduced as a means to address challenges of conventional energy sources. The uncertainties of supply-side (upstream) externalities (e.g., collection and logistics) represent the key challenges in bioenergy supply chains and lead to reduce cross-cutting sustainability benefits. We propose a mixed biomass-based energy supply chain (consisting of mixed-mode bio-refineries and mixed-pathway transportation) and a multi-criteria decision making framework to address the upstream challenges. Our developed framework supports decisions influencing the economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Economic analysis employs a support vector machine technique, to predict the pattern of uncertainty parameters, and a stochastic optimization model, to incorporate uncertainties into the model. The stochastic model minimizes the total annual cost of the proposed mixed supply chain network by using a genetic algorithm. Environmental impact analysis employs life cycle assessment to evaluate the global warming potential of the cost-effective supply chain network. Our presented approach is capable of enhancing sustainability benefits of bioenergy industry infrastructure. A case study for the Pacific Northwest is used to demonstrate the application of the methodology and to verify the models. The results indicate that mixed supply chains can improve sustainability performance over traditional supply infrastructures by reducing costs (up to 24%) and environmental impacts (up to 5%).",Mirkouei A.,2017-01-01,A mixed biomass-based energy supply chain for enhancing economic and environmental sustainability benefits: A multi-criteria decision making framework

In this paper, based on the size calculation model of the traditional flat-plate CPC, the light acceptance uniformities on the acceptance surfaces with different truncations are compared by the Lighttools simulation software. After which, a novel biaxial tracking CPC with a special truncation called well distributed CPC(WD-CPC) and its optimization design are proposed. The light distribution uniformity of the acceptance surface can be improved by WD-CPC, which also has a higher lighting half-angle and a smaller height-width ratio. As shown by simulations, the light non-uniformity of the WD-CPC can be decreased to 0.13 or lower, which is 27.2% of a common CPC. While Measured by experiment, the actual light uniformity of the WD-CPC is 0.153, which is in agreement with simulations.

Probability density forecasting methods can effectively quantify the uncertainty of power load forecasting. The paper proposes a short-term power load probability density forecasting method using kernel-based support vector quantile regression (KSVQR) and Copula theory. As the kernel function can influence the prediction performance, three kernel functions are compared in this work to select the best one for the learning target. The paper evaluates the accuracy of the prediction intervals considering two criteria, prediction interval coverage probability (PICP) and prediction interval normalized average width (PINAW). Considering uncertainty factors and the correlation of explanatory variables for power load prediction accuracy are of great importance. A probability density forecasting method based on Copula theory is proposed in order to achieve the relational diagram of electrical load and real-time price.

Secondly, particle swarm optimization-based evolutionary least squares support vector regression is used to forecast each mode. Thirdly, the forecasted values of all the modes are composed into the ones of the original carbon price.

SCOPUS_ID:85034252444,"Radio frequency (RF) dielectric barrier discharge plasma was used to exfoliate graphite oxide (GO) into graphene. The GO was synthesized from a modified Hummers method. The exfoliation occurred swiftly once the RF power and gas pressure reached a level that enabled sufficient energy transfer from the plasma to the GO. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed that graphene or carbon nanosheets were successfully prepared. The plasma exfoliation mechanism was revealed based on the microstructure characterization and optical emission spectroscopy, which indicated that oxygen was released at the moment of exfoliation. Inspired by the success of GO exfoliation, N-doping was realized by treating polypyrrole-modified GO with plasmas. The N concentration in the resulted graphene depended strongly on the plasma gas. Of the gases studied, CH4 treated polypyrrole-modified GO (GO-PPY-CH4) contained considerable concentration of N that was beneficial to electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs). Supercapacitors made of the N-doped graphene exhibited promising capacitive characteristics. Electrochemical measurements showed that the GO-PPY-CH4 presented an initial specific capacitance of ~312Fg−1 under 0.1Ag−1 charge/discharge current and ~100% retention after 1000 consecutive cycles under currents ranging from 0.1 to 10.0Ag−1 in 6molL−1 KOH electrolyte.

SCOPUS_ID:85017145999,"Traffic state estimation (TSE) refers to the process of the inference of traffic state variables (i.e., flow, density, speed and other equivalent variables) on road segments using partially observed traffic data. It is a key component of traffic control and operations, because traffic variables are measured not everywhere due to technological and financial limitations, and their measurement is noisy. Therefore, numerous studies have proposed TSE methods relying on various approaches, traffic flow models, and input data. In this review article, we conduct a survey of highway TSE methods, a topic which has gained great attention in the recent decades.
                  We characterize existing TSE methods based on three fundamental elements: estimation approach, traffic flow model, and input data. Estimation approach encompasses methods that estimate the traffic state, based on partial observation and a priori knowledge (assumptions) on traffic dynamics. Estimation approaches can be roughly classified into three according to their dependency on a priori knowledge and empirical data: model-driven, data-driven, and streaming-data-driven. A traffic flow model usually means a physics-based mathematical model representing traffic dynamics, with various solution methods. Input data can be characterized by using three different properties: collection method (stationary or mobile), data representation (disaggregated or aggregated), and temporal condition (real-time or historical).
                  Based on our proposed characterization, we present the current state of TSE research and proposed future research directions. Some of the findings of this article are summarized as follows. We present model-driven approaches commonly used. We summarize the recent usage of detailed disaggregated mobile data for the purpose of TSE. The use of these models and data will raise a challenging problem due to the fact that conventional macroscopic models are not always consistent with detailed disaggregated data. Therefore, we show two possibilities in order to solve this problem: improvement of theoretical models, and the use of data-driven or streaming-data-driven approaches, which recent studies have begun to consider. Another open problem is explicit consideration of traffic demand and route-choice in a large-scale network; for this problem, emerging data sources and machine learning would be useful.",Seo T.,2017-01-01,Traffic state estimation on highway: A comprehensive survey

On this basis, optimized GEP (gene expression programming) is applied to precisely formulate the relationships between historical data and electricity consumption. The optimized GEP is a more recent extension of GEP with high probability of finding closed-form solution in mathematical modeling without prior knowledge about the nature of the relationships between variables. This merit is provided by balancing the exploration of solution structure and exploitation of its appropriate weighting factors through use of a robust and efficient optimization algorithm in learning process of GEP.

However, electricity price series usually has complex features such as non-linearity, non-stationarity and volatility, which makes the price forecasting turn out to be very difficult.

In this study, partial cDNA sequences of the Pf_TLR18 and Pf_TLR19 genes and complete cDNA sequence of the Pf_TLR21 gene were cloned from yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco). The open reading frames (ORFs) of the Pf_TLR18, Pf_TLR19 and Pf_TLR21 genes were 1956 bp, 2262 bp and 2949 bp in length, encoding 651, 753 and 982 amino acids, respectively. The Pf_TLR18 and Pf_TLR19 consist of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), a transmembrane domain and a Toll/interleukin-I receptor domain, and the Pf_TLR21 only has LRRs and TIR domain. Homologous identity revealed that the Pf_TLR18, Pf_TLR19 and Pf_TLR21 genes have high nucleotide and protein sequence similarity with channel catfish, especially the TIR domains that exhibited the greatest conservation compared to channel catfish. Ontogenetic expression analyses indicated that the mRNA expressions of the Pf_TLR18, Pf_TLR19 and Pf_TLR21 genes could be detected from fertilized eggs to 30 day post-hatching and they exhibited different variation trends after hatching.

Due to the difference in the stiffness and material at rail welded joints, rail damage and geometric degradation will occur and evolve under repeated train loads, which will significantly influence the wheel-rail dynamic interaction. In this paper, geometric measurements of the rail surface are made at the single flush welding zone by a tracking test on Datong-Qinhangdao heavy haul railway line in China. Fractal geometry theory is applied to calculate the fractal dimension and describe the geometric evolution of rail weld irregularities. Then, the vehicle-track coupled dynamic model is used to investigate the effect of the geometric evolution of rail weld on the wheel-rail dynamic interactions both in the time and frequency domains. The calculation results show that rail weld irregularities have fractal characteristics due to the fractal dimension of measured geometries mostly larger than 1.1. The geometry evolution of rail welded irregularity has great effects on the wheel-rail dynamic interactions in the time domain, but has little effects in the frequency domain. Fractal geometry theory can be used to describe the geometry evolution of rail weld irregularity and the effect on the wheel-rail dynamic interactions.

A BESS needs to have a control algorithm to provide a very good estimation of the load on the grid at each time step. A short-term load forecast (STLF) is necessary for efficient and optimized control of BESSs that are connected to the grid. In this work, two parallel-series techniques for load forecasting are proposed to optimize the performance of a grid-scale BESS (1 MW, 1.1 kWh) in 15-min steps within a moving 24-h window. In both techniques, a complex-valued neural network (CVNN) is used for parallel forecasting. The parallel component is based on the search for similar days of historical data that have a weekly index comparable to the forecast day. For series forecasting, historical data of each day is used within a moving forecast window by CVNN along with the spline method. For both techniques, parallel forecasting is mixed with series forecasting by an adjustment coefficient.

Three ITS datasets extracted from finance market and energy market are used to compare the prediction performance of the HoltI-MSVR with five selected competitors. The experimental results are judged on the basis of statistical criteria, i.e., the goodness of forecast measure and the accuracy compared to competing forecasts test, and economic criteria, i.e., the returns obtained from a simple trading strategy based on the interval forecasts.

These techniques can overcome some disadvantages of traditional modeling, especially the drawback of not being able to model high-dimensional multicollinear data. This research paper compares the performance of estimating motorized travel mode choice through ANN and CT with a binary logit in a multicollinear study case (aggregated and disaggregated covariates). The dataset refers to an Origin-Destination Survey carried out in São Paulo Metropolitan Area, Brazil in 2007. Classification techniques have shown a good ability to forecast (approximately 80% match rate), as well as to recognize travel behavior patterns. Furthermore, by using the classifier application, the most important covariates within all the datasets can be selected. These covariates can be related to households, as well as to Traffic Analysis Zones.",Lindner A.,2017-01-01,Estimating motorized travel mode choice using classifiers: An application for high-dimensional multicollinear data

SCOPUS_ID:85022051499,"Accurate wind speed forecasting is crucial to reliable and secure power generation system. However, the intermittent and unstable nature of wind speed makes it very difficult to be predicted accurately. This paper proposes a novel hybrid model based on variational mode decomposition (VMD), phase space reconstruction (PSR) and wavelet neural network optimized by genetic algorithm (GAWNN) for multi-step ahead wind speed forecasting. In the proposed model, VMD is firstly applied to disassemble the original wind speed series into a number of components in order to improve the overall prediction accuracy. Then, the multi-step ahead forecasting for each component is conducted using GAWNN model in which the input-output sample pairs are determined by PSR technique. Finally, the ultimate forecast series of wind speed is obtained by aggregating the forecast result of each component. The proposed model is tested using two real-world wind speed series collected respectively in spring and autumn from a wind farm located in Xinjiang, China. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms all other comparison models including persistence method, PSR-BPNN, PSR-WNN, PSR-GAWNN and EEMD-PSR-GAWNN models adopted in this paper, which demonstrates that the proposed model has superior performances for multi-step ahead wind speed forecasting.",Wang D.,2017-01-01,Multi-step ahead wind speed forecasting using an improved wavelet neural network combining variational mode decomposition and phase space reconstruction

SCOPUS_ID:85013756743,"In some cases such as the power grid in eastern China, a regional power system analysis is confronted with multiple challenges: dynamics of electricity demands, nonlinearity of the relationship between these demands and influencing factors, fluctuation of system features, risks of resource unavailabilities, spatial heterogeneities of power supplies and demands, dynamical diversity and interactions of system components, and the multi-layer interactions of these challenges. In order to address these challenges, a regional heuristic interval recourse power system analysis (RHIRPSA) method is developed in this study and applied to electricity and environmental systems planning in eastern china. RHIRPSA can predict electricity demands effectively, and allow for incorporation of interval uncertainties into the optimization process and solutions in electricity systems. The objective is to maximize system profits under constraints of resources availability and environmental regulations. Three scenarios are considered to reflect the influence of different emission reduction policies on power generation and power dispatching. The results indicate that reasonable decision alternatives are generated. This study is helpful for (a) facilitating electricity consumption estimation, (b) providing reliable electricity systems management schemes to guide activities such as electricity-conversion technological development, capacity expansion and electricity allocation, (c) mitigating conflicts and interactions among economic profits, electricity generation patterns, air pollution emission control and system reliability, and (d) identifying the desired strategies for improving air quality in eastern China through optimizing the economic and environmental protection measures under policies of air pollution emission reduction.",Huang R.,2017-01-01,Regional heuristic interval recourse power system analysis for electricity and environmental systems planning in Eastern China

SCOPUS_ID:85014820454,"Wind speed forecasting plays a vital role in power system management, planning and integration. In previous studies, most forecasting models have focused on improving the accuracy or stability of wind speed forecasting. However, for an effective forecasting model, considering only one criterion (accuracy or stability) is insufficient. In this paper, a novel combined forecasting model was proposed and successfully employed to solve the problem of simultaneously obtaining both high accuracy and strong stability in wind speed forecasting. The proposed model consists of four ANNs (artificial neural networks) with optimum weight coefficients based on MOBA (multi-objective bat algorithm). MOBA overcomes the defect that only one criterion can be achieved by single objective optimization algorithms. In addition, data decomposition and de-noising are also incorporated in the data pre-processing stage. Ten-minute wind speed data from three datasets in Penglai, China, were selected for multi-step ahead forecasting to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed combined model. The experimental results indicate that the combined model outperforms other comparison models for generating forecasts in terms of forecasting accuracy and stability.",Wang J.,2017-01-01,Research and application of a combined model based on multi-objective optimization for multi-step ahead wind speed forecasting

The mechanism underlying this, however, remains unclear, so it's difficult to control and reduce the phenomenon. Results suggested that lignifying structure, the shrinkage of hyphae tissues and tightening of tubular structure, were observed in SEM owing to transportation of moisture distribution. The transverse relaxation time of free water and immobilized water mobilized significantly, and only 1.26 ± 0.34 and 1.15 ± 0.17 g/100 g bound water was left in the stipe and pileus after 12 h. Furthermore, the increase of lignin content illustrated that HAD process promoted lignification of L. edodes, along with the increase of total polyphenol content and cellulose content. HAD process promoted the lignification of L. edodes by increasing the content of lignin, which was attributed to the elevation of total polyphenol content and regulated by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and peroxidases (POD). These results will serve as a theoretical underpinning for elucidating the mechanism of lignification in L. edodes and controlling this deterioration phenomenon during HAD process in food processing.",Yang W.,2017-01-01,Research on quantitative evaluation of innovation capability of intelligent grid industry cluster based on BP NNA-taking Jiangsu power grid industry cluster as an example

SCOPUS_ID:84950129527,"Time-series analyses of temperature data are important for investigating temperature variation and predicting temperature change. Here, Mann–Kendall (M–K) analyses of temperature time-series data in northeastern Bangladesh indicated increasing trends (Sen’s slope of maximum and minimum yearly temperature at Sylhet of 0.03°C and 0.026°C, respectively, and a minimum temperature at Sreemangal of 0.024°C) except for the maximum temperature at Sreemangal. The linear trends showed that the maximum temperature is increasing by 2.97°C and 0.59°C per hundred years, and the minimum, by 2.17°C and 2.73°C per hundred years at the Sylhet and Sreemangal stations, indicating that climate change is affecting temperature in this area. This paper presents an alternative method for temperature prediction by combining the wavelet technique with an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and an artificial neural network (ANN) applied to monthly maximum and minimum temperature data. The data are divided into a training dataset (1957–2000) to construct the models and a testing dataset (2001–2012) to estimate their performance. The calibration and validation performance of the models is evaluated statistically, and the relative performance based on the predictive capability of out-of-sample forecasts is assessed.

SCOPUS_ID:85020384830,"Against a backdrop of increasing energy demand, the development of wave energy technology is a logical means of both meeting this demand and mitigating the environmental degradation associated with conventional power generation. Previous research has made considerable progress in the climatic characterization and short-term forecasting of wave energy. However, medium- to long-term predictions of wave energy resources, which are central to the development of future operating and trading strategies, remain scarce. This study provides an overview of long-term climatic trends and medium- to long-term predictions of wave energy, before discussing the focus of future predictions. Finally, a new method is proposed for predicting wave energy resources on a medium- to long-term basis that incorporates the swell index and propagation characteristics of swell energy. This model was developed with the aim of improving the precision of wave energy predictions, thereby providing a reference for the effective utilization of wave resources. The results of this study demonstrate that long-term climatic trend analysis should include not only variations in wave power density (WPD), but also long-term variability in wave energy stability, energy level occurrence, and variability in the occurrence of effective significant wave height (SWH). The medium- to long-term prediction of wave energy should also synthetically consider the above factors. We conclude that monitoring the propagation of swell energy and calculating the swell index constitutes a robust theoretical basis for predicting the WPD of mixed wave.",Zheng C.W.,2017-01-01,An overview of medium- to long-term predictions of global wave energy resources

To quantify causal dependencies, a mutual information based metric is presented and an energy prediction approach is subsequently proposed based on the STPN framework. To validate the proposed scheme, two case studies are presented, one involving wind turbine power prediction (supply side energy) using the Western Wind Integration data set generated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for identifying spatiotemporal characteristics, and the other, residential electric energy disaggregation (demand side energy) using the Building America 2010 data set from NREL for exploring temporal features.

                  Intraoperative ultrasonography is widely used in neurosurgery for the management of intracerebral hematoma and brain tumor. However, the clinical value of this method in the surgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) has not been reported. In this study, the application of intraoperative ultrasonography for AVM surgery was evaluated prospectively.
               
               
                  Methods
                  This prospective clinical study comprised 41 patients who underwent microsurgical resection of cerebral AVMs at our institute. After routine craniotomy, ultrasonographic imaging with color Doppler ultrasonography and real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasonographic angiography if necessary were applied as navigated images on the monitor during the operation.
               
               
                  Results
                  Ultrasonographic imaging made it easier to understand the vascular architecture during the operation. Color Doppler flow imaging clearly delineated the shape and margin of the AVMs. Intraoperative real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasonographic angiography enabled the surgeons to categorically identify AVM feeders both on the surface and deep in the tissue.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  Microneurosurgery with intraoperative ultrasonographic image guidance was a safe, effective, and reliable method for identifying the afferent and efferent vessels and for confirming the complete resection of AVMs. These benefits of image-guided microsurgery were mostly apparent for deep-seated AVMs that were not visible on the surface of the brain.",Xu H.-Y.,2017-01-01,Bunching index for bulk cargo ports
SCOPUS_ID:85009775811,"Cellular triglycerides (TG) are stored in cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs). Perilipins (PLIN) are a group of LD-proteins that play important roles in the assembly and transport of LDs and in TG metabolism. Two members of the PLIN family are found in insects (PLIN1 & 2 or Lsd1 & 2). We have cloned and expressed Manduca sexta PLIN2 (MsPLIN2), and studied developmental and nutritional changes in the expression of PLIN2. Nutritional changes induced fast alterations in PLIN2 mRNA and protein levels in fat body and midgut of the feeding larvae. The relationship observed between PLIN2 expression and TG synthesis in both larval fat body and midgut suggests that PLIN2 is needed when tissues are accumulating TG. However, when the fat body was storing TG at maximal capacity, MsPLIN2 levels declined. This unexpected finding suggests the occurrence of alternative mechanism/s to shield TG from the action of lipases in M. sexta LDs. In addition, it implies that the cellular level of lipid storage could be modulating MsPLIN2 expression and/or degradation. The study also confirmed that MsPLIN2 was most abundant in the adult fat body, which is characterized by a high rate of TG hydrolysis and lipid mobilization. Whether MsPLIN2 is directly involved in lipolysis and/or the secretion of lipids in the fat body of adult of M. sexta is unknown at this time. Nonetheless, the coexistence of high PLIN2 and lipolysis levels suggests a complex role for MsPLIN2. Altogether, we found that MsPLIN2 is needed when the synthesis of glycerides, DG and TG, is active even if the insect is accumulating or consuming TG.",Chen X.,2017-01-01,A Quality-of-Content-Based Joint Source and Channel Coding for Human Detections in a Mobile Surveillance Cloud

SCOPUS_ID:85016147799,"In the past decades, simulation frameworks have greatly increased in complexity, due to coupling of models from various disciplines into so-called integrated models. Recently, the combination with tools for uncertainty quantification, inverse modelling, optimization and control started a development towards what we call extended simulation frameworks. While there is an ongoing discussion on quality assurance and reproducibility for simulation frameworks, we have not observed a similar discussion for the extended case. Particularly for extended frameworks, the need for quality assurance is high: The overwhelming range of options and algorithms is unmanageable by a domain expert and opaque to decision makers or the public. The resulting demand for ‘intelligent software’ with automated configuration can lead to a blind trust in simulation results even if they are incorrect. This is a threatening scenario due to potential consequences in simulation-based engineering or political decisions. In this paper, we analyze the increasing complexity of scientific computing workflows, and discuss the corresponding problems of extended scientific simulation frameworks. We propose a paradigm that regulates the allowable properties of framework components, supports the framework configuration for complex simulations, enforces automatic self-tests of configured frameworks, and communicates automated algorithm choices, potentially critical user settings or convergence issues with adaptive detail level and urgency to the end-user. Our goal is to start transferring the quality assurance discussion in the field of integrated modeling and conventional software frameworks to the area of extended simulation frameworks.

Building energy prediction can be broadly classified into engineering, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based, and hybrid approaches. While engineering and hybrid approaches use thermodynamic equations to estimate energy use, the AI-based approach uses historical data to predict future energy use under constraints. Owing to the ease of use and adaptability to seek optimal solutions in a rapid manner, the AI-based approach has gained popularity in recent years. For this reason and to discuss recent developments in the AI-based approaches for building energy use prediction, this paper conducts an in-depth review of single AI-based methods such as multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and support vector regression, and ensemble prediction method that, by combining multiple single AI-based prediction models improves the prediction accuracy manifold.

SCOPUS_ID:85010288568,"Forecasting solar radiation (G) is extremely crucial for engineering applications (e.g. design of solar furnaces and energy-efficient buildings, solar concentrators, photovoltaic-systems and a site-selection of sites for future power plants). To establish long-term sustainability of solar energy, energy practitioners utilize versatile predictive models of G as an indispensable decision-making tool. Notwithstanding this, sparsity of solar sites, instrument maintenance, policy and fiscal issues constraint the availability of model input data that must be used for forecasting the onsite value of G. To surmount these challenge, low-cost, readily-available satellite products accessible over large spatial domains can provide viable alternatives. In this paper, the preciseness of artificial neural network (ANN) for predictive modelling of G is evaluated for regional Queensland, which employed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land-surface temperature (LST) as an effective predictor. To couple an ANN model with satellite-derived variable, the LST data over 2012–2014 are acquired in seven groups, with three sites per group where the data for first two (2012–2013) are utilised for model development and the third (2014) group for cross-validation. For monthly horizon, the ANN model is optimized by trialing 55 neuronal architectures, while for seasonal forecasting, nine neuronal architectures are trailed with time-lagged LST. ANN coupled with zero lagged LST utilised scaled conjugate gradient algorithm, and while ANN with time-lagged LST utilised Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. To ascertain conclusive results, the objective model is evaluated via multiple linear regression (MLR) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) algorithms. Results showed that an ANN model outperformed MLR and ARIMA models where an analysis yielded 39% of cumulative errors in smallest magnitude bracket, whereas MLR and ARIMA produced 15% and 25%.

SCOPUS_ID:85008946441,"With the growing share of wind power production in the electric power grids, many critical challenges to the grid operators have been emerged in terms of the power balance, power quality, voltage support, frequency stability, load scheduling, unit commitment and spinning reserve calculations. To overcome such problems, numerous studies have been conducted to predict the wind power production, but a small number of them have attempted to improve the prediction accuracy by employing the multidimensional meteorological input data. The novelties of this study lie in the proposal of an efficient and easy to implement very short-term wind power prediction model based on the k-nearest neighbor classifier (kNN), in the usage of wind speed, wind direction, barometric pressure and air temperature parameters as the multi-tupled meteorological inputs and in the comparison of wind power prediction results with respect to the persistence reference model. As a result of the achieved patterns, we characterize the variation of wind power prediction errors according to the input tuples, distance measures and neighbor numbers, and uncover the most influential and the most ineffective meteorological parameters on the optimization of wind power prediction results.",Yesilbudak M.,2017-01-01,A novel implementation of kNN classifier based on multi-tupled meteorological input data for wind power prediction

SCOPUS_ID:85029819733,"Forecasting methods are one of the most efficient available approaches to make managerial decisions in various fields of science. Forecasting is a powerful approach in the planning process, policy choices and economic performance. The accuracy of forecasting is an important factor affects the quality of decisions that generally has a direct non-strict relationship with the decisions quality. This is the most important reason that why the endeavor for enhancement the forecasting accuracy has never been stopped in the literature. Electricity load forecasting is one of the most challenging areas forecasting and important factors in the management of energy systems and economic performance. Determining the level of the electricity load is essential for precise planning and implementation of the necessary policies. For this reason electricity load forecasting is important for financial and operational managers of electricity distribution. The unique feature of the electricity which makes it more difficult for forecasting in comparison with other commodities is the impossibility of storing it in order to use in the future. In other words, the production and consumption of electricity should be taken simultaneously. It has caused to create a high level of complexity and ambiguity in electricity markets. Computational intelligence and soft computing approaches are among the most precise and useful approaches for modeling the complexity and uncertainty in data, respectively. In the literature, several hybrid models have been developed in order to simultaneously use unique advantages of these models. However, iterative suboptimal meta-heuristic based models are always used for combining in these models. In this paper, a direct optimum parallel hybrid (DOPH) model is proposed based on multilayer perceptrons (MLP) neural network, Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) in order to electricity load forecasting. The main idea of the proposed model is to simultaneously use advantages of these models in modeling complex and ambiguous systems in a direct and optimal structure. It can be theoretically demonstrated that the proposed model due to use the direct optimal structure, can achieve non-less accuracy than iterative suboptimal hybrid models, while its computational costs are significantly lower than those hybrid models. Empirical results indicate that the proposed model can achieve more accurate results rather than its component and some other seasonal hybrid models.",Chahkoutahi F.,2017-01-01,A seasonal direct optimal hybrid model of computational intelligence and soft computing techniques for electricity load forecasting

Since it was reported that a highly selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, NS398, completely inhibited IL-1β-induced sleep in rats, IL-1β-induced sleep had been believed to be mediated by prostanoids, most probably PGD2. However, in the present study, pretreatment of rats with NS398 (3mg/kg) did not suppress the 64.2% increased non-rapid eye movement (non-REM, NREM) sleep during infusion of IL-1β (10ng) for 6h in the nocturnal (active) period between 23:00 and 5:00 into the subarachnoid space of the PGD2-sensitive sleep-promoting zone of the basal forebrain. Meanwhile, IL-1β at doses of 1.7 and 5μg/kg also significantly increased NREM sleep for 6h after intraperitoneal injection at 20:00 (light-off time) by 76.8% and 121.1%, respectively, in wild-type (WT) mice, by 67.7% and 147.3%, respectively, in WT mice pretreated with NS398 (5mg/kg) and by 108.9% and 121.6%, respectively, in PGD2 receptor (DP1R) knockout mice.

However, it is often assumed to be stationary for the hydrologic time series which will result in an insignificant “spurious regression”. Actually, irrigation water is largely determined by rainfall and crop water requirement in the irrigation district. With the wavelet analysis method, the varying fluctuation characteristics of rainfall, irrigation water, and crop water requirement with multi-temporal scales are exhibited. The cointegration equilibrium relationship amongst their original time series and decomposed time series are also revealed by the cointegration theory. Combining the wavelet analysis method with the cointegration theory, the wavelet-cointegration prediction model of irrigation water is proposed.

SCOPUS_ID:85026204323,"To raise the wind speed prediction accuracy, Wavelet Transform (WT) is widely employed to disaggregate an original wind speed series into several sub series before forecasting. However, the highest frequency sub series usually has a great disturbance on the final prediction. In the study, for raising the forecasting accuracy, Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) is applied to make further processing on the highest frequency sub series, instead of making no modification on or getting rid of it. So a hybrid decomposition technology called Improved WT (IWT) is proposed. Meanwhile, a new hybrid model IWT-ENN combined with IWT and Elman Neural Network (ENN) is also designed. The procedure of IWT is systematically investigated. Experimental results show that: (1) the performance of the hybrid model IWT-ENN has a great improvement compared to that of others including the persistence method, ENN, Auto-Regressive (AR) model, Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Empirical Mode decomposition (EMD)-ENN; (2) compared to the two general strategies where the highest frequency sub series is without retreatment or eliminated, the new proposed hybrid model IWT-ENN has the best prediction performance.",Yu C.,2017-01-01,An improved Wavelet Transform using Singular Spectrum Analysis for wind speed forecasting based on Elman Neural Network

To achieve the goal of load forecasting with both accuracy and stability, a combined model based on a multi-objective optimization algorithm, the multi-objective flower pollination algorithm (MOFPA), is developed in this study. In this combined model, MOPFA is used to optimize the weights of single models to simultaneously obtain high accuracy and great stability, which are two mostly independent objectives and are equally important to the model effectiveness. Data preprocessing techniques, such as the fast ensemble empirical mode decomposition and multiple seasonal patterns, are also incorporated in this model. Case studies of half-hourly electrical load data from the State of Victoria, the State of Queensland, and New South Wales, Australia, are considered as illustrative examples to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the developed combined model.

SCOPUS_ID:84995812337,"The increasing availability of opportunistic and dedicated sensors is transforming a once data-starved transport field into one of the most data-rich. While link-level travel time information can be derived or inferred from this data, methods for estimation of trip travel times between an origin and a destination pair are still evolving and limited, especially in the context of probability distribution estimation. This paper proposes a generalized Markov chain approach for estimating the probability distribution of trip travel times from link travel time distributions and takes into consideration correlations in time and space. The proposed approach consists of three major components, namely state definition, transition probabilities estimation and probability distribution estimation. A heuristic clustering method, based on Gaussian mixture models, has been developed to cluster link travel time observations with regard to their homogeneity and underlying traffic conditions. A transition probability estimation model is developed as a function of link characteristics and trip conditions using a logit model. By applying a Markov chain procedure, the probability distribution of trip travel times is estimated as the combination of Markov path travel time distributions weighted by their corresponding occurrence probabilities. The link travel time distribution is conditioned on the traffic conditions of the current link that can be estimated from historical observations. A moment generating function based algorithm is used to approximate the Markov path travel time distribution as the sum of correlated link travel time distributions conditional on traffic conditions. The proposed approach is applied in a transit case study using automatic vehicle location data. The results indicate that the method is effective and efficient, especially when correlations and multimodal distributions exist.",Ma Z.,2017-01-01,Estimation of trip travel time distribution using a generalized Markov chain approach

Although there have been a large number of investigations on wind resource characteristics, the local wind resource characteristics in a mountain wind farm are still a lack. To fill this knowledge gap, high-resolution wind data are extracted for investigating from multiple-unit SCADA data, that is, wind data are collected from four selected wind turbines with SCADA system, which means wind data are from four different locations. For each location, more than thirty million sets of wind data are extracted for investigation in 2015. Then, several kinds of probability density functions (PDFs) are compared, and one-dimensional and multidimensional kernel density estimation method is selected for the investigation of the frequency distribution. Data preprocessing methods of both wind speed and wind direction are also presented. Finally, the results of this investigation reveal the specific change characteristics of wind speed and wind direction in the investigated mountain wind farm.

For this exploratory study, DEA-ANN are combined into a two-stage modeling approach. While it is frequently used as a benchmarking tool, DEA lacks predictive capabilities. However, ANN has strong nonlinear mapping and adaptive prediction functionality. In this study, the advantages of combining these complementary methods into an integrated performance measurement and prediction model are explored. For this combined approach, a Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes (CCR) DEA model is used to evaluate the efficiency of each decision making unit (DMU) and to capture the efficiency trend of each railroad. Based upon those DEA results, the follow-on backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model predicts an efficiency score and target output for each DMU. This is a new attempt to extend the BPNN model for purposes of best performance prediction. The resulting framework is an effective benchmarking and decision support system which adds adaptive prediction capabilities to current benchmarking practices.",Kwon H.-B.,2017-01-01,Exploring the predictive potential of artificial neural networks in conjunction with DEA in railroad performance modeling

SCOPUS_ID:85008716286,"Due to the uncertainty of wind power and complex constraints of available hydro, short term hydro-wind-thermal scheduling (HWTS) is one of the most difficult optimization problems in the operational planning of power systems. This paper presents a risk-aware optimization model, named probability interval optimization (PIO), to reliably evaluate the HWTS from the perspective of risk and profit. In PIO, the uncertain wind power is deemed as a probability interval variable, the risk of wind power is assessed by its probability distribution, and the profit is manifested by the decrease of generation cost between the same system with and without wind power integrated. For solving the PIO model, an evolutionary predator and prey strategy (EPPS) is proposed in this paper. The EPPS focuses on dynamically adjusting the algorithm’s exploration and exploitation abilities by introducing an escaping mechanism and a classification mechanism. In addition, a heuristic repair mechanism, instead of penalty function approach, is applied to handle the complex equality and inequality constraints of HWTS. Simulation studies based on three HWTS systems demonstrate that the risk-aware PIO model is well reliable and applicable to solve HWTS considering the uncertain wind power integrated, the EPPS algorithm can obtain superior solutions in comparison with other recently developed algorithms, and the heuristic repair mechanism is efficient for dealing with complex constraints of HWTS.",Chen J.J.,2017-01-01,Risk-aware short term hydro-wind-thermal scheduling using a probability interval optimization model

MAF can be quantified with spatially explicit process-based models, which might be overly time-consuming and data-intensive for this purpose, or with empirical regression models that predict MAF based on climate and catchment characteristics. Yet, regression models have mostly been developed at a regional scale and the extent to which they can be extrapolated to other regions is not known. In this study, we developed a global-scale regression model for MAF based on a dataset unprecedented in size, using observations of discharge and catchment characteristics from 1885 catchments worldwide, measuring between 2 and 106
                     km2. In addition, we compared the performance of the regression model with the predictive ability of the spatially explicit global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB by comparing results from both models to independent measurements. We obtained a regression model explaining 89% of the variance in MAF based on catchment area and catchment averaged mean annual precipitation and air temperature, slope and elevation. The regression model performed better than PCR-GLOBWB for the prediction of MAF, as root-mean-square error (RMSE) values were lower (0.29–0.38 compared to 0.49–0.57) and the modified index of agreement (d) was higher (0.80–0.83 compared to 0.72–0.75).

The dynamic operational flexibility was evaluated by the real-time upward and downward ramp capacity. Simulation results show that the generation resource mix plays a crucial role in evaluating the value of improved wind power forecasting at different timescales. In addition, the changes in annual operational electricity generation costs were mostly influenced by the dominant resource in the system. Finally, the impacts of pumped-storage resources, generation ramp rates, and system minimum generation level requirements on the value of improved wind power forecasting were also analyzed.",Wang Q.,2016-12-15,"The value of improved wind power forecasting: Grid flexibility quantification, ramp capability analysis, and impacts of electricity market operation timescales"
SCOPUS_ID:84994045716,"Some of the challenges to predict energy utilization has gained recognition in the residential sector due to the significant energy consumption in recent decades. However, the modeling of residential building energy consumption is still underdeveloped for optimal and robust solutions while this research area has become of greater relevance with significant advances in computation and simulation. Such advances include the advent of artificial intelligence research in statistical model development. Artificial neural network has emerged as a key method to address the issue of nonlinearity of building energy data and the robust calculation of large and dynamic data. The development and validation of such models on one of the TxAIRE Research houses has been demonstrated in this paper.

This paper presents a data driven approach for analysis and forecast of aggregate space and water thermal load in buildings. The analysis and the forecast models are built using district heating data unobtrusively collected from 10 residential and commercial buildings located in Skellefteå, Sweden. The load forecast models are generated using supervised machine learning techniques, namely, support vector machine, regression tree, feed forward neural network, and multiple linear regression. The model takes the outdoor temperature, historical values of heat load, time factor variables and physical parameters of district heating substations as its input. A performance comparison among the machine learning methods and identification of the importance of models input variables is carried out. The models are evaluated with varying forecast horizons of every hour from 1 up to 48h. Our results show that support vector machine, feed forward neural network and multiple linear regression are more suitable machine learning methods with lower performance errors than the regression tree.

SCOPUS_ID:85004147130,"Soil water content (SWC) is a key factor in optimizing the usage of water resources in agriculture since it provides information to make an accurate estimation of crop water demand. Methods for predicting SWC that have simple data requirements are needed to achieve an optimal irrigation schedule, especially for various water-saving irrigation strategies that are required to resolve both food and water security issues under conditions of water shortages. Thus, a two-year field investigation was carried out to provide a dataset to compare the effectiveness of HYDRUS-2D, a physically-based numerical model, with various machine-learning models, including Multiple Linear Regressions (MLR), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), for simulating time series of SWC data under water stress conditions. SWC was monitored using TDRs during the maize growing seasons of 2010 and 2011. Eight combinations of six, simple, independent parameters, including pan evaporation and average air temperature as atmospheric parameters, cumulative growth degree days (cGDD) and crop coefficient (Kc
                     ) as crop factors, and water deficit (WD) and irrigation depth (In) as crop stress factors, were adopted for the estimation of SWCs in the machine-learning models. Having Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) in the range of 0.54–2.07mm, HYDRUS-2D ranked first for the SWC estimation, while the ANFIS and SVM models with input datasets of cGDD, Kc
                     , WD and In ranked next with RMSEs ranging from 1.27 to 1.9mm and mean bias errors of −0.07 to 0.27mm, respectively. However, the MLR models did not perform well for SWC forecasting, mainly due to non-linear changes of SWCs under the irrigation process. The results demonstrated that despite requiring only simple input data, the ANFIS and SVM models could be favorably used for SWC predictions under water stress conditions, especially when there is a lack of data. However, process-based numerical models are undoubtedly a better choice for predicting SWCs with lower uncertainties when required data are available, and thus for designing water saving strategies for agriculture and for other environmental applications requiring estimates of SWCs.",Karandish F.,2016-12-01,A comparison of numerical and machine-learning modeling of soil water content with limited input data

A novel combined forecasting method based on Back Propagation (BP) neural network, Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Difference Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (diff-SARIMA) are presented in this paper. Firstly, the combined method uses all the three methods (BP, ANFIS, diff-SARIMA) to forecast respectively, and the three forecasting results were obtained. By multiplying optimal weight coefficients of the three forecasting results respectively and then adding them up, in the end the final forecasting results can be obtained. Among the three individual methods, BP and ANFIS had the ability to deal with the nonlinearity data, and diff-SARIMA had the ability to deal with the linearity and seasonality data. So the combined method eliminates drawbacks and incorporates in the merits of the individual methods. It has the capability to deal with the linearity, nonlinearity and seasonality data. In order to optimize weight coefficients, Differential Evolution (DE) optimization algorithm is brought into the combined method. To prove the superiority and accuracy, the capability of the combined method is verified by comparing it with the three individual methods. The forecasting results of the combined method proved to be better than all the three individual methods and the combined method was able to reduce errors and improve the accuracy between the actual values and forecasted values effectively.

                  In this paper, we propose a novel classification scheme for smart grid systems where the collected data are processed in order to increase the efficiency of electricity transportation as well as demand-supply management. The new scheme is based on forecasting the consumption time series obtained from a smart meter. Class assignment is determined using the forecast error. Different linear and nonlinear methods were tested based on the corresponding assumptions on the statistical behavior of the underlying consumption time series.

Many previous studies have tried to determine a way to accurately predict the box-office, but the results reported have not been satisfactory for two main reasons: (1) lack of variable diversity and (2) simplicity of forecasting algorithms. Although the importance of word-of-mouth (WOM) has consistently emphasized in past studies, only summarized information, such as volume or valence of user ratings is commonly used. In forecasting algorithms, multiple linear regression is the most popular algorithm because it generates not only predicted values but also variable significances. In this study, new box-office forecasting models are presented to enhance the forecasting accuracy by utilizing review sentiments and employing non-linear machine learning algorithms. Viewer sentiments from review texts are used as input variables in addition to conventional predictors, whereas three machine learning-based algorithms, i.e., classification and regression tree (CART), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector regression (SVR), are employed to capture non-linear relationship between the box-office and its predictors.

The use of accurate prediction tools is an issue that awakens a lot of interest among transport researchers. Intermodal freight forecasting plays an important role in ports management and in the planning of the principal port activities.

Nevertheless, missing data, which can bias the original properties of the time series if the pattern of missed data is systematic, is also a very common phenomenon in observed processes. Thus, how to address missing values is a very important challenge, especially in the upcoming big data era. This paper proposes the cuckoo search-designated fractal interpolation functions (CS-DFIFs) method and the CS-DFIFs-winners combining (CS-DFIFs-WC) method for estimating missing values. The former method skillfully transforms Fractal Interpolation Functions (FIFs) to make it possible to calculate a specified point's missing value, which is difficult to obtain with the traditional approach. Then, to optimize the parameters that transforming process generates, the cuckoo search algorithm (CS) and DFIFs are synthesized into a novel model, CS-DFIFs. Considering classical interpolation methods, such as Linear, Cubic Spline and Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolation Polynomial (PCHIP), having some born advantages, the inspiration of winners combining is sparked. CS algorithm is used to obtain the best weights of winners in this combined model, CS-DFIFs-WC. Two databases, electricity demands and prices, are chosen to be the numerical testing object at 7 missing levels in this paper. The results show that CS-DFIFs-WC overcomes the deficiency of FIFs that cannot calculate a specified point's missing value, and outperforms benchmarks at almost every level by four criteria.",Jiang P.,2016-12-01,Cuckoo search-designated fractal interpolation functions with winner combination for estimating missing values in time series

The goal of our paper is to suggest a new statistical modeling method that finds the best historical dataset according to various analyses for each link and provides a more accurate prediction of traffic flow by day of the week. First, we suggest a three-step filtering algorithm based on changepoint analysis, correlation analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation to simultaneously find and remove historical data outliers. Second, we determine the optimal historical data range by using decision factors such as the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Akaike Information Criterion. Moreover, to verify our statistical model, we use various prediction accuracy measures such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), R-squared value, and Root MSE (RMSE). Finally, we construct a big data processing framework to handle the overall prediction process and calculate large amounts of traffic data.

This algorithm could be generalized to incorporate any planning problem where wind or PV power is part of its parameters. Moreover, an adequate time representation that mimics the fluctuation of renewable resource based DGs and chronologically matches the fluctuations in system demand is presented.

System operators have to provide complementary power and relevant control strategies to smooth out the fluctuations when large-scale wind power ones is injected into the grid. To better smooth the fluctuations, the change rate of the wind speed is a critical piece of information. In this study, the variogram function is introduced to measure the change rate of the wind speed. Based on the variogram time-series, some statistical analyses are conducted. These results contribute to a better understanding of the characteristics of the change rate of the wind speed, such as the chronological variation pattern of the change rate on a day, whether the future change rate can be forecasted, and whether there is a relationship between the change rate and wind speed.",Liu J.,2016-12-01,Variogram time-series analysis of wind speed

SCOPUS_ID:84969514519,"We explore whether, and to what extent, traders in a real world financial market, where participants’ judgements are reportedly well calibrated, are subject to duration misperception. To achieve this, we examine duration misperception in the horserace betting market. We develop a two-stage algorithm to predict horses’ winning probabilities that account for a duration-related factor that is known to affect horses’ winning prospects. The algorithm adapts survival analysis and combines it with the conditional logit model. Using a dataset of 4736 horseraces and the lifetime career statistics of the 53,295 horses running in these races, we demonstrate that prices fail to discount fully information related to duration since a horse's last win. We show that this failure is extremely costly, since a betting strategy based on the predictions arising from the model shows substantial profits (932.5 percent and 16.27 percent, with and without reinvestment of winnings, respectively). We discuss the important implications of duration neglect in the wider economy.",Ma T.,2016-12-01,Time is money: Costing the impact of duration misperception in market prices
SCOPUS_ID:84984985673,"Efficient and effective city planning in improving the energy performance of residential buildings requires a clear understanding of the influential features. Previous studies on modeling the relationships between influential features and the energy consumption have several gaps and limitations, such as the linear modeling methodology and insufficient consideration of particular features. This study therefore aims at investigating the influence of 171 possibly related features on the regional energy use intensity (EUI) of residential buildings using a non-linear regression algorithm, namely Random Forests (RF). The New York City (NYC) was focused on due to data availability. The 171 features covered seven different aspects, which are building, economy, education, environment, households, surrounding, and transportation. The average site EUI of the residential buildings in each Block Group (BG) was set as the dependent variable. The regression model was compared to the models using typical linear methods, such as Multiple Linear Regression and Lasso. The results show that the RF model achieved a lower mean square error. In addition, the top 20 influential features were identified based on the out-of-bag estimation in RF. Results show that less percentage of well-educated people, higher percentage of households heated by fuel oil, lower household income and more residential complaints per capita are correlated with higher average site EUI in NYC. Related suggestions on improving the energy performance in different regions are presented to the local government.",Ma J.,2016-12-01,Identifying the influential features on the regional energy use intensity of residential buildings based on Random Forests

This paper proposes a novel approach, which hybridizes support vector regression model with fruit fly optimization algorithm and the seasonal index adjustment to forecast monthly electricity consumption. Besides, in order to comprehensively evaluate the forecasting performance of the hybrid model, a small sample of monthly electricity consumption of China and a large sample of monthly electricity retail sales of the United States were employed to demonstrate the forecasting performance.

SCOPUS_ID:84961198334,"This paper presents a novel design of interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems (IT2FLS) by utilizing the theory of extreme learning machine (ELM) for electricity load demand forecasting. ELM has become a popular learning algorithm for single hidden layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFN). From the functional equivalence between the SLFN and fuzzy inference system, a hybrid of fuzzy-ELM has gained attention of the researchers. This paper extends the concept of fuzzy-ELM to an IT2FLS based on ELM (IT2FELM). In the proposed design the antecedent membership function parameters of the IT2FLS are generated randomly, whereas the consequent part parameters are determined analytically by the Moore–Penrose pseudo inverse. The ELM strategy ensures fast learning of the IT2FLS as well as optimality of the parameters. Effectiveness of the proposed design of IT2FLS is demonstrated with the application of forecasting nonlinear and chaotic data sets. Nonlinear data of electricity load from the Australian National Electricity Market for the Victoria region and from the Ontario Electricity Market are considered here. The proposed model is also applied to forecast Mackey-glass chaotic time series data. Comparative analysis of the proposed model is conducted with some traditional models such as neural networks (NN) and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). In order to verify the structure of the proposed design of IT2FLS an alternate design of IT2FLS based on Kalman filter (KF) is also utilized for the comparison purposes.",Hassan S.,2016-11-01,A systematic design of interval type-2 fuzzy logic system using extreme learning machine for electricity load demand forecasting
SCOPUS_ID:84977512343,"The purpose of this study is to develop a hybrid methodology that integrates machine learning algorithms with multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques to effectively conduct multi-attribute inventory analysis. In the proposed methodology, first, ABC analyses using three different MCDM methods (i.e. simple-additive weighting, analytical hierarchy process, and VIKOR) are employed to determine the appropriate class for each of the inventory items. Following this, naïve Bayes, Bayesian network, artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are implemented to predict classes of initially determined stock items. Finally, the detailed prediction performance metrics of algorithms for each method are determined. The comprehensive case study executed at a large-scale automotive company revealed that the best classification accuracy is achieved by SVMs. The results also revealed that Bayesian networks, SVMs and ANNs are all capable of successfully dealing with the unbalanced data problems associated with Pareto distribution, and each of these algorithms performed well against all examined measures, thus validating the fact that machine learning algorithms are highly applicable to inventory classification problems. Therefore, this study presents uniqueness in that it is the first and foremost of its kind to effectively combine MCDM methods with machine learning algorithms in multi-attribute inventory classification and is practically applicable in various inventory settings.

SCOPUS_ID:84994591754,"Monthly stream-flow forecasting can yield important information for hydrological applications including sustainable design of rural and urban water management systems, optimization of water resource allocations, water use, pricing and water quality assessment, and agriculture and irrigation operations. The motivation for exploring and developing expert predictive models is an ongoing endeavor for hydrological applications. In this study, the potential of a relatively new data-driven method, namely the extreme learning machine (ELM) method, was explored for forecasting monthly stream-flow discharge rates in the Tigris River, Iraq. The ELM algorithm is a single-layer feedforward neural network (SLFNs) which randomly selects the input weights, hidden layer biases and analytically determines the output weights of the SLFNs. Based on the partial autocorrelation functions of historical stream-flow data, a set of five input combinations with lagged stream-flow values are employed to establish the best forecasting model. A comparative investigation is conducted to evaluate the performance of the ELM compared to other data-driven models: support vector regression (SVR) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN). The forecasting metrics defined as the correlation coefficient (r), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E
                     NS), Willmott’s Index (WI), root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) computed between the observed and forecasted stream-flow data are employed to assess the ELM model’s effectiveness. The results revealed that the ELM model outperformed the SVR and the GRNN models across a number of statistical measures. In quantitative terms, superiority of ELM over SVR and GRNN models was exhibited by E

SCOPUS_ID:84989227517,"The economical operation of many distributed energy assets relies on effective on-line control, which in turn often requires forecasts to be made. To produce and evaluate forecasts, the error metric by which one measures forecast accuracy must be selected. A new method is presented which customizes a forecast error metric to a given on-line control problem instance, in order to improve the controller's performance. This method is applied to the real-time operation of a battery with the objective of minimizing the peak power drawn by an aggregation of customers over a billing period. In the empirical example considered, customizing the forecast error metric to each problem instance, improved performance by 45% on average, compared to a controller provided with a forecast of the same type, but trained to minimize mean-squared-error. Error metric customization is made possible by two newly proposed parametrized error metrics. The proposed method can be applied to any on-line optimization problem which requires a point forecast as an input, and which can be accurately simulated ahead of time. The method is likely to be most effective in applications where forecasting errors are quite high, as in these applications the choice of forecast error metric significantly affects the forecasts which are produced.",Abdulla K.,2016-11-01,Improving the on-line control of energy storage via forecast error metric customization

SCOPUS_ID:84955577214,"Short-term electricity load forecasting plays an important role in the energy market as accurate forecasting is beneficial for power dispatching, unit commitment, fuel allocation and so on. This paper reviews a few single hidden layer network configurations with random weights (RWSLFN). The RWSLFN was extended to eight variants based on the presence or absence of input layer bias, hidden layer bias and direct input–output connections. In order to avoid mapping the weighted inputs into the saturation region of the enhancement nodes’ activation function and to suppress the outliers in the input data, a quantile scaling algorithm to re-distribute the randomly weighted inputs is proposed. The eight variations of RWSLFN are assessed using six generic time series datasets and 12 load demand time series datasets. The result shows that the RWSLFNs with direct input–output connections (known as the random vector functional link network or RVFL network) have statistically significantly better performance than the RWSLFN configurations without direct input–output connections, possibly due to the fact that the direct input–output connections in the RVFL network emulate the time delayed finite impulse response (FIR) filter. However the RVFL network has simpler training and higher accuracy than the FIR based two stage neural network. The RVFL network is also compared with some reported forecasting methods. The RVFL network overall outperforms the non-ensemble methods, namely the persistence method, seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (sARIMA), artificial neural network (ANN). In addition, the testing time of the RVFL network is the shortest while the training time is comparable to the other reported methods. Finally, possible future research directions are pointed out.",Ren Y.,2016-11-01,Random vector functional link network for short-term electricity load demand forecasting

Furthermore, a novel dynamic system model of the electricity supply-consumption-price is proposed. By means of Lyapunov exponents and bifurcation diagrams, the dynamic behaviors of the system are analyzed, and an electricity market attractor is achieved. Then the model is applied to China's electricity market. With the statistical data of China between 1997 and 2012, the parameters for establishing a China-specific dynamic system of electricity market are identified by artificial neural network of machine learning. Owing to the actual system in China's electricity market is unstable, four efficient single regulatory strategies have been found by means of bifurcation diagrams. And comparative scenario analysis is employed based on the influences to electricity market and electricity balance index under all kinds of regulatory strength and regulatory strategies. The results show that the current actual situation in China's electricity market should be considered, and excessive regulation should be avoided. At the same time, it is found that the integrated regulatory strategies are better than the single regulatory strategies, and the optimal regulatory strategy of the integrated regulatory strategies is strategy-2,3,4.

SCOPUS_ID:84989887256,"We discuss methods for net load forecasting and their significance for operation and management of power grids with high renewable energy penetration. Net load forecasting is an enabling technology for the integration of microgrid fleets with the macrogrid. Net load represents the load that is traded between the grids (microgrid and utility grid). It is important for resource allocation and electricity market participation at the point of common coupling between the interconnected grids. We compare two inherently different approaches: additive and integrated net load forecast models. The proposed methodologies are validated on a microgrid with 33% annual renewable energy (solar) penetration. A heuristics based solar forecasting technique is proposed, achieving skill of 24.20%. The integrated solar and load forecasting model outperforms the additive model by 10.69% and the uncertainty range for the additive model is larger than the integrated model by 2.2%. Thus, for grid applications an integrated forecast model is recommended. We find that the net load forecast errors and the solar forecasting errors are cointegrated with a common stochastic drift. This is useful for future planning and modeling because the solar energy time-series allows to infer important features of the net load time-series, such as expected variability and uncertainty.",Kaur A.,2016-11-01,Net load forecasting for high renewable energy penetration grids
SCOPUS_ID:84983517684,"This study examined various regression-based techniques and an artificial neural network used for streamflow forecasting during typhoons. A flow hydrograph was decomposed into two segments, rising and falling limbs, and the individual segments were modeled using statistical techniques. In addition, a conceptual rainfall–runoff model, namely the Public Works Research Institute (PWRI)-distributed hydrological model, and statistical models were compared. The study area was the Tsengwen Reservoir watershed in Southern Taiwan. The data used in this study comprised the observed watershed rainfalls, reservoir inflows, typhoon characteristics, and ground weather data. The forecast horizons ranged from 1 to 12 h. A series of assessments, including statistical analyses and simulations, was conducted. According to the improvements in errors, among single-segment statistical models, the multilayer perceptron achieved superior prediction accurary compared with the regression-based methods. However, the pace regression was the most favorable according to an evaluation of model complexity and accuracy. To examine the robustness of the results for forecast horizons varying from 1 to 12 h, statistical significance tests were performed for the single- and two-segment models. The prediction ability of the two-segment models was superior to that of the single-segment models. In addition, Typhoon Sinlaku in 2008 was considered in a comparison between the conceptual PWRI model output and that of the developed statistical models. The results showed that the PWRI model yielded the least favorable results.",Wei C.-C.,2016-11-01,Comparing single- and two-segment statistical models with a conceptual rainfall-runoff model for river streamflow prediction during typhoons

We find that MD&A accruals explain a statistically and economically significant portion of firm-level accruals and identify more persistent accruals. We find that the explanatory power of MD&A accruals is higher for more readable 10-Ks, thereby providing evidence for the construct validity of the readability measures. To highlight the flexibility of the SVR method, we apply it to other dependent variables and disclosures. We find that MD&A-based cash-flow forecasts produced by SVR predict next period’s cash flows. We apply SVR to conference call transcripts and find accruals estimates have similar explanatory power to MD&A accruals. Finally, the explanatory power of MD&A accruals increases between 1994 and 2013.",Frankel R.,2016-11-01,Using unstructured and qualitative disclosures to explain accruals

Many meta-heuristic algorithms have been proposed in literature for the optimization of Neural Network (NN) to build a forecasting model. In this paper, as an alternative to previous methods, we propose a new flower pollination algorithm with remarkable balance between consistency and exploration for NN training to build a model for the forecasting of petroleum consumption by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The proposed approach is compared with established meta-heuristic algorithms. The results show that the new proposed method outperforms existing algorithms by advancing OPEC petroleum consumption forecast accuracy and convergence speed. Our proposed method has the potential to be used as an important tool in forecasting OPEC petroleum consumption to be used by OPEC authorities and other global oil-related organizations. This will facilitate proper monitoring and control of OPEC petroleum consumption.",Chiroma H.,2016-11-01,A new approach for forecasting OPEC petroleum consumption based on neural network train by using flower pollination algorithm

Existing social influence research primarily focuses on friendship networks among people. We propose a general approach to measure social influence in a type of objective entity, specifically in company networks. To construct the company influence network, we mine network links (company relationships) from the news and obtain node attributes (company influence) from search indices. Using the company influence network, two social influence measures are explored: the number of peers and weighted peer effects. To address time-series data, all variables are integrated into a vector autoregression model to forecast the company’s financial performance in terms of stock return and risk. The results of our simulation and robust testing suggest that our social influence measures have the power to predict firm financial performance.",Luo P.,2016-11-01,Measuring social influence for firm-level financial performance
SCOPUS_ID:84961825685,"Energy consumption is on the rise in developing economies. In order to improve present and future energy supplies, forecasting energy demands is essential. However, lack of accurate and comprehensive data set to predict the future demand is one of big problems in these countries. Therefore, using ensemble hybrid forecasting models that can deal with shortage of data set could be a suitable solution. In this paper, the annual energy consumption in Iran is forecasted using 3 patterns of ARIMA–ANFIS model. In the first pattern, ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model is implemented on 4 input features, where its nonlinear residuals are forecasted by 6 different ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System) structures including grid partitioning, sub clustering, and fuzzy c means clustering (each with 2 training algorithms). In the second pattern, the forecasting of ARIMA in addition to 4 input features is assumed as input variables for ANFIS prediction. Therefore, four mentioned inputs beside ARIMA’s output are used in energy prediction with 6 different ANFIS structures. In the third pattern, due to dealing with data insufficiency, the second pattern is applied with AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) data diversification model and a novel ensemble methodology is presented.
                  The results indicate that proposed hybrid patterns improve the accuracy of single ARIMA and ANFIS models in forecasting energy consumption, though third pattern, used diversification model, acts better than others and model’s MSE criterion was decreased to 0.026% from 0.058% of second hybrid pattern. Finally, a comprehensive comparison between other hybrid prediction models is done.",Barak S.,2016-11-01,Forecasting energy consumption using ensemble ARIMA-ANFIS hybrid algorithm
SCOPUS_ID:84978763098,"With the growing smartwatch market over the past few years, smartwatch acceptance in consumer markets has become an important topic for both researchers and designers. Identification of factors that influence consumers to accept a smartwatch can improve user-centered design. This study explores the intentions of using a smartwatch from the consumer perspective, combining innovation diffusion theory (IDT), the technology acceptance model (TAM), the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), and perceived enjoyment. It presents an integrated method empirically tested with data from 212 participants in Taiwan. Partial lease squares (PLS) were used for models and hypotheses tests. We find several interesting results greatly different from previous studies: (1) Attitude, often identified as a weak mediator, is significant; (2) Ease of use was not significant, which implies that it should be the basic specification of smartwatches; (3) Gender has no significant effect on acceptance of smartwatches; and (4) Individuals 35–54 years old exhibit a significant demand for enjoyment in their use of smartwatch. This study contributes to the technology acceptance research field, and identifies the characteristics that influence smartwatch acceptance.

SCOPUS_ID:84989837130,"There is a broad spectrum of BR (Biofuel Related) models. However the models are highly specific. Such models cannot flexibly support complex decision making activities to identify feasible trade-offs among many objective functions. They represent just one point of view; e.g. engineering, company economics. Therefore CBRMs (Complex Biofuel Related Model) are studied in this paper. CBRMs must cover additional aspects, e.g. macroeconomic, ecology, sociology and politics. Such models are inevitably unique, partially subjective, inconsistent, vague and multidimensional. AI (Artificial Intelligence) has developed a number of tools to solve such problems. Qualitative reasoning is one of them. It is based on the least information intensive quantifiers i.e. trends. There are just three trend / qualitative values: plus/increasing; zero/constant; negative/decreasing. There are many CBRM items related to soft aspects e.g. politics, taxation etc. which cannot be quantified by numbers. They are too vague. For example – if the political/sociological sensitivity of land ownership is increasing then the cost of biofuels is increasing. Such verbal knowledge item cannot be incorporated into a traditional numerical model. The paper describes developments of CBRMs based on expert knowledge and common sense. A consensus among experts is often not reached because of substantial subjectivity of experts’ knowledge. A qualitative intersection of CBRMs developed by several experts is simple. The case study presents a model based on integration of 10 heuristics using 9 variables e.g. Refinery Capacity, Cost of Biofuel Production, and Biofuel Demand. The result is represented by 13 scenarios. The paper is self-contained, no a prior knowledge of qualitative models is required.",Dohnal M.,2016-11-01,Complex biofuels related scenarios generated by qualitative reasoning under severe information shortages: A review
SCOPUS_ID:84987942253,"Following the scarcity of resources, rising energy prices, and an increasing awareness of the role manufacturing plays in the generation of greenhouse gas emissions, the consumption of energy has more and more been the subject of research on production planning over the last decade. Even though recent years have witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of works published in this area, several related research questions have been opened up without sufficiently linking research approaches and research insights. The aim of this paper is to investigate the links between these questions and to highlight how the modeling approaches developed for different manufacturing systems, energy pricing policies, and energy efficiency criteria can benefit from each other and lead to more advanced energy-efficient production planning approaches. Therefore, this paper provides a review of the state-of-the-art of decision support models that integrate energy aspects into mid-term and short-term production planning of manufacturing companies. The paper first highlights the increasing importance of energy consumption in manufacturing and shows how considering energy consumption in production planning can contribute to more energy-efficient production processes. Subsequently, the paper outlines the review methodology used and descriptively analyzes the sampled papers. Afterwards, the selected papers are categorized according to the production planning tasks considered. From this classification, gaps in the existing literature are derived and potential areas for future research are suggested.",Biel K.,2016-11-01,Systematic literature review of decision support models for energy-efficient production planning
SCOPUS_ID:84992761586,"Extreme environmental events such as droughts affect millions of people all around the world. Although it is not possible to prevent this type of event, its prediction under different time horizons enables the mitigation of eventual damages caused by its occurrence. An important variable for identifying occurrences of droughts is the sea surface temperature (SST). In the tropical Atlantic Ocean, SST data are collected and provided by the Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) project, which is an observation network composed of sensor buoys arranged in this region. Sensors of this type, and more generally Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, commonly lead to data losses that influence the quality of datasets collected for adjusting prediction models. In this paper, we explore the influence of temporal aggregation in predicting step-ahead SST considering different prediction horizons and different sizes for training datasets. We have conducted several experiments using data collected by PIRATA project. Our results point out scenarios for training datasets and prediction horizons indicating whether or not temporal aggregated SST time series may be beneficial for prediction.",Salles R.,2016-11-01,Evaluating temporal aggregation for predicting the sea surface temperature of the Atlantic Ocean

This study proposes the use of an active contour algorithm combined with computational textures on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to analyze salt diffusion in Iberian hams in a non-destructive way. Data mining techniques (OneR, J48 decision tree, and multiple linear regression) were tested for i) classifying ham muscles and processing stages as a function of salt diffusion and ii) predicting salt content. The proposed methods are useful to differentiate the images of different muscles and stages of processing. For classification purposes, the best procedure is applying the J48 decision tree on the Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) method (77.88–79.21% of correct classification). For predicting salt content, the application of multiple linear regression on GLCM methods is accurate (R2 = 0.972–0.994 and MAE = 0.007–0.044).

For quantifying uncertainty associated with power load and obtaining more information of future load, a probability density forecasting method based on quantile regression neural network using triangle kernel function (QRNNT) is proposed. The nonlinear structure of neural network is applied to transform the quantile regression model for constructing probabilistic forecasting method. Moreover, the triangle kernel function and direct plug-in bandwidth selection method are employed to perform kernel density estimation. To verify the efficiency, the proposed method is used for Canada's and China's load forecasting.

SCOPUS_ID:84991294549,"This paper is aimed on the analysis of monthly spot oil prices (WTI) between 1986 and 2015. The methodology is based on Dynamic Model Averaging (DMA) and Dynamic Model Selection (DMS) framework. The important feature of DMA method is an allowance for both time-varying coefficients and large state space model (i.e., the set of oil price determinants can change in time). Within this framework it was explicitly shown how the significance of oil price determinants vary in time. These determinants itself were chosen with respect to some previous studies. Contrary to the currently reported DMA applications in some other fields, no significant evidence was found that DMA is superior over, for example, ARIMA model. However, DMA could also not been rejected as a significantly worse model due to certain statistical tests. The performed DMA analysis was checked for robustness on various model parameters and for certain computational issues.
                  It was found, for example, that in the context of the 2008 oil price peak exchange rates and stock markets were important oil price drivers, whereas oil production or oil import were just minor determinants. Some role of the change in inventories was found, but not greater than the one in 1991. The role of China's economy as an oil price driver in 2008 was found to be relatively smaller than in other time periods. Also, the robustness of these findings was discussed.",Drachal K.,2016-11-01,Forecasting spot oil price in a dynamic model averaging framework — Have the determinants changed over time?

SCOPUS_ID:84990928845,"Building on regulatory focus theory and the theory of action phases, we propose that the opportunity seeking of the entrepreneurial mindset is fueled by promotion focus, but transformed from something that liberates individuals from sub-optimal goals into something that traps them in escalation scenarios depending on the stability of environmental conditions faced, the duration of the project, and the specificity of the goal being pursued. Our meta-theoretical process model of escalation of commitment suggests that the decision to persist is set into motion long before individuals engage in the cost-benefit analysis examined in most escalation studies. We argue that, when individuals seek opportunities in a promotion-focused state of goal striving, they are likely to forego contingency planning, which precludes the formation of an exit strategy and leaves them unable to disengage despite an emerging desire to do so. Worse yet, opportunity seeking under the aforementioned conditions delays detection of an action crisis, which increases risk exposure and allows resources, time, and reputation invested to further accumulate, making disengagement that much more difficult once the entrepreneur realizes that a decision is necessary. Using the events of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster made famous by Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air, we illustrate our proposed model and discuss its implications for entrepreneurship, escalation, and self-regulation research.",McMullen J.S.,2016-11-01,Trapped by the entrepreneurial mindset: Opportunity seeking and escalation of commitment in the Mount Everest disaster

However, this is challenging due to time varying behavior of the underlying network characteristics. In this paper, we present a genetic-algorithm-based prediction model for estimating TCP throughput values. Our approach tries to find the best matching combination of mathematical functions that approximate a given time series that accounts for the TCP throughput samples using genetic algorithm. Based on collected historical datapoints about measured TCP throughput samples, our algorithm estimates expected throughput over time. We evaluate the quality of the prediction using different selection and diversity strategies for creating new chromosomes. Also, we explore the use of different fitness functions in order to evaluate the goodness of a chromosome. The goal is to show how different tuning on the genetic algorithm may have an impact on the prediction. Using extensive simulations over several TCP throughput traces, we find that the genetic algorithm successfully finds reasonable matching mathematical functions that allow to describe the TCP sampled throughput values with good fidelity.

SCOPUS_ID:84977626775,"In last decade, the higher penetration of renewable energy resources (RES) in energy market was encouraged by implementing the energy polices in several developed and developing countries due to increasing environmental concerns. Among wide range of RES, Photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation get higher attention by researcher, energy policy makers and power production companies due to its economic and environmental benefits. Therefore, a large PV penetration was observed in energy market with rapid growth in the last decade. The PV output power is highly uncertain due to several meteorological factors such as temperature, wind speed, cloud cover, atmospheric aerosol levels and humidity level. The inherent variability of PV output power creates different issues directly or indirectly for power grid such as power system control and reliability, reserves cost, dispatchable and ancillary generation, grid integration and power planning. Therefore, there is need to accurately forecast the PV output over the spectrum of forecast horizon at different chronological scales. In this paper, a comprehensive and systematic review of PV output power forecast models were provided. This review covers the different factors affecting PV forecast, PV output power profile and performance matrices to evaluate the forecast model.

In this paper, an incremental learning model of support vector regression (SVR) is proposed to forecast the electric load under the batch arriving and large sample. For modeling with SVR, the optimal embedding of time series is constructed by phase space reconstruction (PSR). Then, an optimal training subset for the training of SVR is extracted based on the current data set, which enables us to cut the high time and space complexity by reducing the full training data set. When newly-increased data are added into the system, a representative data set reconstruction method is presented for quickly re-training the current SVR, and a nested particle swarm optimization (NPSO) framework is presented to select the parameters of the incremental SVR model. Experiments of incremental electric load forecasting demonstrate the computational superiority of the presented model over the comparison models.",Yang Y.,2016-10-15,An incremental electric load forecasting model based on support vector regression
SCOPUS_ID:84982307169,"In an off-grid hybrid wind-diesel-battery system, the diesel generator is often not utilised efficiently, therefore compromising its lifetime. In particular, the general rule of thumb of running the diesel generator at more than 40% of its rated capacity is often unmet. This is due to the variation in power demand and wind speed which needs to be supplied by the diesel generator. In addition, the frequent start-stop of the diesel generator leads to additional mechanical wear and fuel wastage. This research paper proposes a novel control algorithm which optimises the operation of a diesel generator, using genetic algorithm. With a given day-ahead forecast of local renewable energy resource and load demand, it is possible to optimise the operation of a diesel generator, subjected to other pre-defined constraints. Thus, the utilisation of the renewable energy sources to supply electricity can be maximised. Usually, the optimisation studies of a hybrid system are being conducted through simple analytical modelling, coupled with a selected optimisation algorithm to seek the optimised solution. The obtained solution is not verified using a more realistic system model, for instance the physical modelling approach. This often led to the question of the applicability of such optimised operation being used in reality. In order to take a step further, model-based design using Simulink is employed in this research to perform a comparison through a physical modelling approach. The Simulink model has the capability to incorporate the electrical and mechanical (Simscape) physical characteristics into the simulation, which are often neglected by other authors when performing such study.

SCOPUS_ID:84941247752,"Renewable power output is an important factor in scheduling and for improving balanced area control performance. This investigation develops an evolutionary seasonal decomposition least-square support vector regression (ESDLS-SVR) to forecast monthly solar power output. The construction of the ESDLS-SVR uses seasonal decomposition and least-square support vector regression (LS-SVR). Genetic algorithms (GA) are used simultaneously to select the parameters of the LS-SVR. Monthly solar power output data from Taiwan Power Company are used. Empirical results indicate that the proposed forecasting system demonstrates a superior performance in terms of forecasting accuracy. A comparative study has been introduced showing that the ESDLS-SVR model performance is better than autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and LS-SVR models.",Lin K.-P.,2016-10-15,Solar power output forecasting using evolutionary seasonal decomposition least-square support vector regression
SCOPUS_ID:84995532099,"Accurate monthly inbound tourist flow forecasting can provide the reliable guidance for better tourism planning and administration. However, it has been found that the monthly inbound tourist flow demonstrates a complex nonlinear characteristic and an obvious seasonal tendency. Support vector regression (SVR) has been widely applied to handle nonlinear time series prediction, but it suffers from the key parameters selection and the influence of seasonal tendency. This paper proposes a novel approach, namely SFOASVR, which hybridizes SVR model with fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) and the seasonal index adjustment to forecast monthly tourist flow. Besides, in order to comprehensively evaluate the forecasting performance of the hybrid model, two kinds of forecasting horizons, namely single-step-ahead and multi-step-ahead, are used. In addition, the inbound tourist flow to mainland China from January 2000 to December 2013 is used as data set. The results show that the proposed hybrid SFOASVR approach is a viable option for tourist flow forecasting applications.",Lijuan W.,2016-10-15,Seasonal SVR with FOA algorithm for single-step and multi-step ahead forecasting in monthly inbound tourist flow

SCOPUS_ID:84978517168,"Sales forecasting has long been crucial for companies since it is important for financial planning, inventory management, marketing, and customer service. In this study, a novel clustering-based sales forecasting scheme that uses an extreme learning machine (ELM) and assembles the results of linkage methods is proposed. The proposed scheme first uses the K-means algorithm to divide the training sales data into multiple disjointed clusters. Then, for each cluster, the ELM is applied to construct a forecasting model. Finally, a test datum is assigned to the most suitable cluster identified according to the result of combining five linkage methods. The constructed ELM model corresponding to the identified cluster is utilized to perform the final prediction. Two real sales datasets of computer servers collected from two multinational electronics companies are used to illustrate the proposed model. Empirical results showed that the proposed clustering-based sales forecasting scheme statistically outperforms eight benchmark models, and hence demonstrates that the proposed approach is an effective alternative for sales forecasting.",Lu C.-J.,2016-10-01,A clustering-based sales forecasting scheme by using extreme learning machine and ensembling linkage methods with applications to computer server
SCOPUS_ID:84982851420,"Forecasting air passenger demand is a critical aspect of formulating appropriate operation plans in airport operation. Airport operation not only requires long-term demand forecasting to establish long-term plans, but also short-term demand forecasting for more immediate concerns. Most airports forecast their short-term passenger demand based on experience, which provides limited forecasting accuracy, depending on the level of expertise. For accurate short-term forecasting independent of the level of expertise, it is necessary to create reliable short-term forecasting models and to reflect short-term fluctuations in air passenger demand. This study aims to develop a forecasting model of short-term air passenger demand using big data from search queries to identify these short-term fluctuations. The suggested forecasting model presents an average forecast error of 5.3% and indicates that an increase of approximately 195,000 air passengers is to be expected 8months later, as the key query frequencies increase by 0.1%.",Kim S.,2016-10-01,Forecasting short-term air passenger demand using big data from search engine queries
SCOPUS_ID:84978394264,"Scenario discovery is a model-based approach to scenario development under deep uncertainty. Scenario discovery relies on the use of statistical machine learning algorithms. The most frequently used algorithm is the Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM). This algorithm identifies regions in an uncertain model input space that are highly predictive of model outcomes that are of interest. To identify these regions, PRIM uses a hill-climbing optimization procedure. This suggests that PRIM can suffer from the usual defects of hill climbing optimization algorithms, including local optima, plateaus, and ridges and valleys. In case of PRIM, these problems are even more pronounced when dealing with heterogeneously typed data. Drawing inspiration from machine learning research on random forests, we present an improved version of PRIM. This improved version is based on the idea of performing multiple PRIM analyses based on randomly selected features and combining these results using a bagging technique. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated using three cases. Each of the cases has been published before and used PRIM. We compare the results found using PRIM with the results found using the improved version of PRIM. We find that the improved version is more robust to new data, can better cope with heterogeneously typed data, and is less prone to overfitting.",Kwakkel J.H.,2016-10-01,Improving scenario discovery by bagging random boxes

Despite their theoretical promise their empirical accuracy in forecasting has not yet been assessed, either against each other or against any established approaches of forecast combination, model selection, or statistical benchmark algorithms. Also, none of the algorithms have been assessed on a representative set of empirical data, using only few synthetic time series. We remedy this omission by conducting a rigorous empirical evaluation using a representative set of 111 industry time series and a valid and reliable experimental design.

SCOPUS_ID:84992153831,"Groundwater systems are intrinsically heterogeneous with dynamic temporal-spatial patterns, which cause great difficulty in quantifying their complex processes, while reliable predictions of regional groundwater levels are commonly needed for managing water resources to ensure proper service of water demands within a region. In this study, we proposed a novel and flexible soft-computing technique that could effectively extract the complex high-dimensional input–output patterns of basin-wide groundwater–aquifer systems in an adaptive manner. The soft-computing models combined the Self Organized Map (SOM) and the Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous Inputs (NARX) network for predicting monthly regional groundwater levels based on hydrologic forcing data. The SOM could effectively classify the temporal-spatial patterns of regional groundwater levels, the NARX could accurately predict the mean of regional groundwater levels for adjusting the selected SOM, the Kriging was used to interpolate the predictions of the adjusted SOM into finer grids of locations, and consequently the prediction of a monthly regional groundwater level map could be obtained. The Zhuoshui River basin in Taiwan was the study case, and its monthly data sets collected from 203 groundwater stations, 32 rainfall stations and 6 flow stations during 2000and2013 were used for modelling purpose. The results demonstrated that the hybrid SOM-NARX model could reliably and suitably predict monthly basin-wide groundwater levels with high correlations (R2
                     >0.9 in both training and testing cases). The proposed methodology presents a milestone in modelling regional environmental issues and offers an insightful and promising way to predict monthly basin-wide groundwater levels, which is beneficial to authorities for sustainable water resources management.",Chang F.-J.,2016-10-01,Prediction of monthly regional groundwater levels through hybrid soft-computing techniques

This design may potentially improve the usage of the components of the cyber-physical system (CPS), however further protection is needed due to the emerging threat of cyber-attacks. These may degrade the quality of the communicated information which is of fundamental importance in the decision making process.
                  This paper proposes a novel methodology for automatic identification of the type of the integrity attack affecting a CPS. We designed a feature set for capturing the characteristics of each attack in the spectral and wavelet domains while its distribution is learned by pattern recognition algorithms of different modelling properties customized for the specific application scenario. In addition a novelty detection component is incorporated for dealing with previously unseen types of attacks.

                  In this paper, we aim to evaluate the use of electronic technologies in out of hours (OoH) task-management for assisting the design of effective support systems in health care; targeting local facilities, wards or specific working groups. In addition, we seek to draw and validate conclusions with relevance to a frequently revised service, subject to increasing pressures.
               
               
                  Methods and material
                  We have analysed 4 years of digitised demand-data extracted from a recently deployed electronic task-management system, within the Hospital at Night setting in two jointly coordinated hospitals in the United Kingdom. The methodology employed relies on Bayesian inference methods and parameter-driven state-space models for multivariate series of count data.
               
               
                  Results
                  Main results support claims relating to (i) the importance of data-driven staffing alternatives and (ii) demand forecasts serving as a basis to intelligent scheduling within working groups. We have displayed a split in workload patterns across groups of medical and surgical specialities, and sustained assertions regarding staff behaviour and work-need changes according to shifts or days of the week. Also, we have provided evidence regarding the relevance of day-to-day planning and prioritisation.

This paper presents a study in which we propose an architecture that makes use of already stored energy data and external unstructured information to improve knowledge acquisition and allow managers to make better decisions. This external knowledge is represented by a torrent of information that, in many cases, is hidden across heterogeneous and unstructured data sources, which are recuperated by an Information Extraction system.

In order to predict PM2.5 concentration in the Sanandaj air the hybrid models consisting of an ensemble empirical mode decomposition and general regression neural network (EEMD-GRNN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), principal component regression (PCR), and linear model such as multiple liner regression (MLR) model were used. In these models the data of suspended particles of PM2.5 were the dependent variable and the data related to air quality including PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3 and meteorological data including average minimum temperature (Min T), average maximum temperature (Max T), average atmospheric pressure (AP), daily total precipitation (TP), daily relative humidity level of the air (RH) and daily wind speed (WS) for the year 2014 in Sanandaj were the independent variables.

SCOPUS_ID:84978412223,"Cellphone tracking has been recently integrated into risk assessment of disease transmission, because travel behavior of disease carriers can be depicted in unprecedented details. Still in its infancy, such an integration has been limited to: 1) risk assessment only at national and provincial scales, where intra-urban human movements are neglected, and 2) using irregularly logged cellphone data that miss numerous user movements. Furthermore, few risk assessments have considered positional uncertainty of cellphone data. This study proposed a new framework for mapping intra-urban disease risk with regularly logged cellphone tracking data, taking the dengue fever in Shenzhen city as an example. Hourly tracking records of 5.85 million cellphone users, combined with the random forest classification and mosquito activities, were utilized to estimate the local transmission risk of dengue fever and the importation risk through travels. Stochastic simulations were further employed to quantify the uncertainty of risk. The resultant maps suggest targeted interventions to maximally reduce dengue cases exported to other places, as well as appropriate interventions to contain risk in places that import them. Given the popularity of cellphone use in urbanized areas, this framework can be adopted by other cities to design spatio-temporally resolved programs for disease control.",Mao L.,2016-10-01,Mapping intra-urban transmission risk of dengue fever with big hourly cellphone data

SCOPUS_ID:84931051987,"This article addresses the question of how planners’ use and non-use of expert knowledge affect the content and goal achievement potential of plans, and discusses how changes in planners’ and researchers’ practices can contribute to improving goal achievement potential. These are questions that have been given surprisingly little attention in planning research. Although interesting discussions have emerged over recent years, few empirical studies have been presented. This article presents theory-based empirical research on these issues based on analyses of strategic land-use and transport planning processes in three Scandinavian cities where an aim is to limit or reduce traffic volumes and greenhouse gas emissions of transport. This is a highly relevant issue when analysing the effects of planners’ use and non-use of expert knowledge. Goal achievement potential refers to whether plans (if implemented) contribute to achieving defined objectives, which in this paper mainly regards curbing or reducing urban traffic volumes. The expert knowledge in question concerns how land-use and transport systems development influence traffic volumes in urban regions.
                  The article concludes that whether planners use the expert knowledge in question or not, and how they use it, do affect the goal achievement potential of the plans they produce. This knowledge is the main basis for many planners’ knowing and acting. Planners use it to understand, explain and argue for how and why coordination is necessary, and for selecting traffic-reducing measures. All examined plans also include strategies and measures that reduce their goal achievement potential, and non-use of the expert knowledge is an important part of the explanation as to how and why this is the case. When competing objectives seem to call for traffic-increasing measures, planners tend not to take account of expert knowledge in explaining that these measures reduce the goal achievement potential of plans, and they do not turn to it for finding innovative ways of solving their planning problems. Instead, they rely on their embedded professional knowledge, which is sometimes outdated or misleading. In other cases, planners disregard the knowledge because it challenges planning agendas or compelling ideas, or they exercise self-censorship when finding that it conflicts with political agendas.
                  Considerable effort is required in ensuring higher goal achievement potential in future plans. Planners need to be more critical of their own tacit knowledge, and turn more actively to research-based knowledge. Researchers need to produce the knowledge planners need in ways that are useful and usable for them.",Tennoy A.,2016-10-01,How planners’ use and non-use of expert knowledge affect the goal achievement potential of plans: Experiences from strategic land-use and transport planning processes in three Scandinavian cities

SCOPUS_ID:84977563802,"In this paper a large-scale study is presented that applies statistical learning methods to predict future monthly energy consumption for single-family detached homes using building attributes and monthly climate data. Building data is collected from over 426,305 homes in Bexar County, TX with four years of monthly energy consumption (natural gas and electricity). The goal of this study is to establish reliable models for forecasting residential energy consumption, understand the predictive value of building attributes, identify differences in predictability between households, and measure the robustness in model performance given uncertainty in climate forecasts. Assuming accurate climate forecasts, results show future monthly energy consumption can reasonably be predicted for out-of-sample households, with 74% accuracy at the household level and over 90% accuracy for predicting aggregate monthly energy usage. However, model performance is significantly different between households with distinct fuel types. Using historical climate forecast, results also demonstrate that model predictability significantly decays at both the household and aggregate level, but is robust at the household level when measured by the median home. Model selection and variable importance plots illustrate several building characteristics significantly contribute to predicting monthly energy consumption while most provide marginal predictive value.",Williams K.T.,2016-09-15,Predicting future monthly residential energy consumption using building characteristics and climate data: A statistical learning approach

SCOPUS_ID:84978039449,"Occupant’s behavioural patterns determine a significant level of uncertainty in building energy performance evaluation. It is difficult to account for this uncertainty in the design phase when operational and occupancy profiles are unknown. The relevant “performance gap” usually encountered between simulated and measured energy performance is clearly connected to biased assumptions in modeling, especially in the initial design phase. A probabilistic modeling approach is proposed to improve simulation reliability and robustness with respect to variability in occupancy patterns. The case study presented is the eLUX lab of the “Smart Campus” of Brescia University in Italy. Occupancy dependent input parameters such as air change rates (i.e. mechanically controlled ventilation) and internal heat gains (i.e. due to people, lighting and appliances) are described by means of probability distributions to obtain probabilistic thermal demand and load profiles as output. Probabilistic results enables a more reliable identification of energy saving strategies (operational and environmental settings) with respect to highly variable operating conditions. Further, simulation data are processed to obtain a weather-adjusted energy demand visualization, suitable for establishing a continuity between modeling in design and operation phases, with calibration purpose. Calibrated energy models can be used for several specific tasks in the operation phase, in particular condition monitoring, fault detection and diagnosis, supervisory control and energy management. For the case study presented, a detailed data acquisition scheme has been designed to enable an effective monitoring activity in the operation phase, aimed at experimenting model-based approaches for the tasks reported. The proposed research is the point-of-departure for a general activity aimed at assessing critically the issues of reliability and robustness of simulation results obtained with conventional modeling approaches, in particular with respect to occupants’ behaviour, exploiting at the same time the possibility of using measured data as a direct feedback to promote behavioural change.",Tagliabue L.C.,2016-09-15,Probabilistic behavioural modeling in building performance simulation—The Brescia eLUX lab
SCOPUS_ID:84978388583,"Building energy consumption used for internal heating and cooling purposes is one of the most viral research topics. Retrofitting and renovation activities in building applications aim towards utilizing modern construction materials, with improved thermal and insulation characteristics. It is more than evident that such an approach leads to an improved thermal shield for the building (improving passive building elements). In addition well calibrated rule based control designs are also being adopted in the last decades as a way to improve the energy efficiency in buildings (improving active elements management). Both of the above approaches though are considered as time static since disturbances with high uncertainty (weather conditions, human presence and activity) along with the unavoidable construction material aging phenomena affect building behavior and HVAC dynamics. As a result control recalibration activities seem more than necessary to maintain energy efficiency. Followed by the rapid evolution in the computing machines sector and simulation software kits, research effort has been focused on model-assisted and co-simulation based control strategies which utilize the available computational power of modern machines towards improving energy efficiency and comfort levels through appropriate design Building Optimization and Control (BOC) systems, utilizing available system models. However the main drawback in model-assisted strategies is the fact that they heavily rely on the available building model which requires a tedious offline pre-application period including many simulation tests and/or field experiments so as to fine tune and tailor manually the model and consequently the control logic implemented. Moreover, no matter how elaborate the building model is, aging characteristics and uncertain disturbances are factors which call for re-designing (periodically) the available simulation model and the respective control strategies.
                  This paper considers an alternative approach to BOC system design. The main attribute of the proposed methodology is that it can provide automated fine-tuning of the BOC system: no human intervention or a simulation model are required for the initial deployment of the controller as well as for the continuously applied fine-tuning procedure.

SCOPUS_ID:84969204031,"Currently, global warming, frequent occurrence of extreme weather and air pollution are common problems facing the international community. Carbon dioxide emissions are the root causes of these environmental and climate issues. Due to rapid industrialization and urbanization, China has become the world's largest energy consumer and carbon dioxide emitter. Moreover, the manufacturing industry is highly energy-consuming and pollution-intensive, accounting for nearly 60% of China's total energy consumption and over 50% of total carbon dioxide emissions. Thus, identifying the main drivers of the industry's carbon dioxide emissions is vital for China's emission reduction and global efforts to enhance environmental protection. This study uses Vector Autoregressive model to analyze the influencing factors of the changes in carbon dioxide emissions in the industry. The results show that energy efficiency plays a dominant role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Urbanization also has significant effect on carbon dioxide emissions because of large-scale real estate construction and high rate of vehicle ownership. Energy structure has higher impact on emission reduction than industrialization due to massive coal consumption and industrial structure optimization. Therefore, the Chinese government should increase investment in energy-saving technology, optimize energy structure, promote the production and use of new energy and hybrid vehicles.",Xu B.,2016-09-10,Reducing carbon dioxide emissions in China's manufacturing industry: A dynamic vector autoregression approach

SCOPUS_ID:84986212967,"This study proposed ship-based carbon capture and storage (CCS) chains with different CO2 liquefaction pressures and compared them in terms of life cycle cost (LCC) to determine the optimal pressure. Seven liquefaction pressures were suggested between the triple point (5.18bar, −56.6°C) and the critical point (73.8bar, 31.1°C) of CO2 with increments of 10bar, and the chain was divided into five modules: a liquefaction system, storage tanks, a CO2 carrier, storage tanks in the intermediate terminal and a pumping system. LCC, including capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operational expenditure (OPEX), was used to estimate the CAPEX and OPEX of the five systems of the chain with each of the seven liquefaction pressures. The results showed that the optimal liquefaction pressure was 15bar (−27°C), which had an appropriate pressure, temperature, and density. As the liquefaction pressure increased, the costs of the liquefaction and pumping system decreased, and the costs of the storage tanks and CO2 carrier increased. The cost of the liquefaction system was the largest contributor to the LCC, whereas the pumping system accounted for the smallest part. Sensitivity analysis was performed because this study was carried out in an early design stage with data subject to some uncertainty. The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that the optimal pressure was 15bar without regard to the disposal amount, the distance from source to sink, the uncertainty of an employed methodology, and unit electricity cost.",Seo Y.,2016-09-02,Hydrological forecasting using hybrid data-driven approach

SCOPUS_ID:84978803249,"Energy demand prediction is an important problem whose solution is evaluated by policy makers in order to take key decisions affecting the economy of a country. A number of previous approaches to improve the quality of this estimation have been proposed in the last decade, the majority of them applying different machine learning techniques. In this paper, the performance of a robust hybrid approach, composed of a Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm and a new class of neural network called Extreme Learning Machine, is discussed. The Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm is focused on obtaining the most relevant features among the set of initial ones, by including an exponential prediction model. While previous approaches consider that the number of macroeconomic variables used for prediction is a parameter of the algorithm (i.e., it is fixed a priori), the proposed Variable Neighborhood Search method optimizes both: the number of variables and the best ones. After this first step of feature selection, an Extreme Learning Machine network is applied to obtain the final energy demand prediction. Experiments in a real case of energy demand estimation in Spain show the excellent performance of the proposed approach. In particular, the whole method obtains an estimation of the energy demand with an error lower than 2%, even when considering the crisis years, which are a real challenge.",Sanchez-Oro J.,2016-09-01,Robust total energy demand estimation with a hybrid Variable Neighborhood Search – Extreme Learning Machine algorithm

Responsiveness of the market participants can improve reliability of system operation as well as capital cost investments. In this regard, the accurate forecast of electricity price and demand in smart grids is an important challenge as their strong correlation makes a separate forecasting to be ineffective. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm for simultaneous forecast of price and demand that uses a set of effective tools in preprocessing part, forecast engine and tuned algorithm. To highlight our contributions, the proposed forecast algorithm classified into three main parts. The first part employs a new Flexible Wavelet Packet Transform (FWPT) to decompose a signal into multiple terms at different frequencies, and a new feature selection method that employs Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) and adjacent features in order to select valuable input data. The second part consists of a novel Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) model based on Nonlinear Least Square Support Vector Machine (NLSSVM) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) in order to model the linear and nonlinear correlation between price and load in two stages. The final part employs a modified version of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm based on time-varying coefficients and stumble generation operator, called TV-SABC, in order to optimize NLSSVM parameters in a learning process. The proposed hybrid forecasting algorithm is evaluated on several real and well-known markets illustrating its high accuracy in simultaneous forecast of electricity price and demand.

This study developed a novel time-series sliding window metaheuristic optimization-based machine learning system for predicting real-time building energy consumption data collected by a smart grid. The proposed system integrates a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model and metaheuristic firefly algorithm-based least squares support vector regression (MetaFA-LSSVR) model. Specifically, the proposed system fits the SARIMA model to linear data components in the first stage, and the MetaFA-LSSVR model captures nonlinear data components in the second stage. Real-time data retrieved from an experimental smart grid installed in a building were used to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of the proposed system. A k-week sliding window approach is proposed for employing historical data as input for the novel time-series forecasting system. The prediction system yielded high and reliable accuracy rates in 1-day-ahead predictions of building energy consumption, with a total error rate of 1.181% and mean absolute error of 0.026kWh. Notably, the system demonstrates an improved accuracy rate in the range of 36.8–113.2% relative to those of the linear forecasting model (i.e., SARIMA) and nonlinear forecasting models (i.e., LSSVR and MetaFA-LSSVR).

SCOPUS_ID:84976489397,"Waste burial in uncontrolled landfills can cause serious environmental damages and unpleasant consequences. Leachates produced in landfills have the potential to contaminate soil and groundwater resources. Leachate management is one of the major issues with respect to landfills environmental impacts. Improper design of landfills can lead to leachate spread in the environment, and hence, engineered landfills are required to have leachate monitoring programs. The high cost of such programs may be greatly reduced and cost efficiency of the program may be optimized if one can predict leachate contamination level and foresee management and treatment strategies. The aim of this study is to develop two expert systems consisting of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Principal Component Analysis-M5P (PCA-M5P) models to predict Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) load in leachates produced in lab-scale landfills. Measured data from three landfill lysimeters, including rainfall depth, number of days after waste deposition, thickness of top and bottom Compacted Clay Liners (CCLs), and thickness of top cover over the lysimeter, were utilized to develop, train, validate, and test the expert systems and predict the leachate COD load. Statistical analysis of the prediction results showed that both models possess good prediction ability with a slight superiority for ANN over PCA-M5P. Based on test datasets, the mean absolute percentage error for ANN and PCA-M5P models were 4% and 12%, respectively, and the correlation coefficient for both models was greater than 0.98. Developed models may be used as a rough estimate for leachate COD load prediction in primary landfill designs, where the effect of a top and/or bottom liner is disputed.",Azadi S.,2016-09-01,Evaluating the ability of artificial neural network and PCA-M5P models in predicting leachate COD load in landfills

Many established LULC models use transition potential maps for the allocation of the estimated land demand. This study compares three commonly used techniques for transition potential modelling: (1) Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP), (2) Logistic Regression (LogReg), and (3) Similarity Weighted Instance-based Learning (SimWeight); and evaluates their applicability for built-up transitions. A case study has been taken from Guwahati city, in North-East India which experiences heterogeneous built-up growth in a limited area within the large topographic variations. With the same set of input and tested driving factors, all three models were simulated for the period 1989–2001 to produce the transition potential maps for 2011 and same amount of land demands, as in 2011 were allocated on the potential maps. The validation was done by (1) a multi-resolution validation method and (2) a region based method using the wards of the city. For this particular study, with the specific landscape environment and scale, MLP produced the most accurate change and predicted areas. The LogReg simulated the no change areas the most accurately, while the SimWeight could generate the edge extensions satisfactorily. We presented a detailed comparison of the change potentials and simulated maps and discuss the importance of evaluating the ability of the transition potential model used for LULC model.

SCOPUS_ID:84975824344,"Hydrological forecasting is complicated by flow regime alterations in a coupled socio-hydrologic system, encountering increasingly non-stationary, nonlinear and irregular changes, which make decision support difficult for future water resources management. Currently, many hybrid data-driven models, based on the decomposition–prediction-reconstruction principle, have been developed to improve the ability to make predictions of annual streamflow. However, there exist many problems that require further investigation, the chief among which is the direction of trend components decomposed from annual streamflow series and is always difficult to ascertain. In this paper, a hybrid data-driven model was proposed to capture this issue, which combined empirical mode decomposition (EMD), radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN), and external forces (EF) variable, also called the CEREF model. The hybrid model employed EMD for decomposition and RBFNN for intrinsic mode function (IMF) forecasting, and determined future trend component directions by regression with EF as basin water demand representing the social component in the socio-hydrologic system. The Wuding River basin was considered for the case study, and two standard statistical measures, root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), were used to evaluate the performance of CEREF model and compare with other models: the autoregressive (AR), RBFNN and EMD–RBFNN. Results indicated that the CEREF model had lower RMSE and MAE statistics, 42.8% and 7.6%, respectively, than did other models, and provided a superior alternative for forecasting annual runoff in the Wuding River basin. Moreover, the CEREF model can enlarge the effective intervals of streamflow forecasting compared to the EMD–RBFNN model by introducing the water demand planned by the government department to improve long-term prediction accuracy. In addition, we considered the high-frequency component, a frequent subject of concern in EMD-based forecasting, and results showed that removing high-frequency component is an effective measure to improve forecasting precision and is suggested for use with the CEREF model for better performance. Finally, the study concluded that the CEREF model can be used to forecast non-stationary annual streamflow change as a co-evolution of hydrologic and social systems with better accuracy. Also, the modification about removing high-frequency can further improve the performance of the CEREF model. It should be noted that the CEREF model is beneficial for data-driven hydrologic forecasting in complex socio-hydrologic systems, and as a simple data-driven socio-hydrologic forecasting model, deserves more attention.",Zhang H.,2016-09-01,CEREF: A hybrid data-driven model for forecasting annual streamflow from a socio-hydrological system
SCOPUS_ID:84971577651,"Cloud’s profitability is mainly driven by the business, and on the other hand, a successful business is hardly geared with clients’ satisfaction. Therefore, there is high competition between cloud providers for satisfying clients and attracting more of them. In this way, long term business success factors should also be considered in addition to short term profit factors regarded in conventional resource provisioning procedures. Conventional resource management approaches to achieve short term profit inevitably lead to job rejection and violation from response time based SLAs while short response time and low job rejection are of those important factors to clients’ satisfaction. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel bipolar resource management framework which results in preventing from job rejection and having considerably reduced violations from response time based SLAs as well as providing short term profits. The proposed framework uses a neural network based predictor and genetic algorithm for optimal resource management through live migration. It also employs a prediction based temporal infinite pool, called the temporal cloud, which regards job rejection prevention. The evaluation of the proposed framework demonstrates that it can provide short term profits, beside it prevents from job rejection and reduces response time violations considerably.",Bahrpeyma F.,2016-09-01,A bipolar resource management framework for resource provisioning in Cloud's virtualized environment

In the new approach, the neural fuzzy inference system was used to create an initial flood susceptibility model and then the model was optimized using two metaheuristic algorithms, Evolutionary Genetic and Particle Swarm Optimization. A high-frequency tropical cyclone area of the Tuong Duong district in Central Vietnam was used as a case study. First, a GIS database for the study area was constructed. The database that includes 76 historical flood inundated areas and ten flood influencing factors was used to develop and validate the proposed model. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to assess the model performance and its prediction capability. Experimental results showed that the proposed model has high performance on both the training (RMSE=0.306, MAE=0.094, AUC=0.962) and validation dataset (RMSE=0.362, MAE=0.130, AUC=0.911). The usability of the proposed model was evaluated by comparing with those obtained from state-of-the art benchmark soft computing techniques such as J48 Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System.

These different viewpoints vary in terms of time frame, from hourly to seasonal, making it difficult for construction models to accurately predict electricity consumption. A polynomial-Fourier series (P-FS) model is developed to analyze period activity and long-term consumption trends for use by middle management and engineers. Case studies show that the P-FS model provides accurate predictions of electricity consumption, which is very useful for evaluating energy policy and determining forward-looking electricity budgets based on limited data inputs and mathematical iterations.",Tsai C.-L.,2016-09-01,Polynomial-Fourier series model for analyzing and predicting electricity consumption in buildings

SCOPUS_ID:84964575507,"For the last years, the research and development in the field of Renewable Energy has been growing due to the need of Renewable Energy as an extended and reliable source of energy. However, the implementation of renewable energy has many complex problems not easily solved with conventional methods. Recently, Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic and Genetic Algorithms, have been widely used to deal with these problems in the field of Renewable Energy. Nevertheless, issues with a degree of uncertainty need Bayesian Networks since this is one of the most effective theories to face them. This technique can contribute to the Renewable Energy harnessing and other open issues on this field. In this work we show the state of the art of the applications of Bayesian Networks in Renewable Energy, such as solar thermal, photovoltaic, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric energies and biomass. Additionally, we include related topics such as energy storage, smart grids and energy assessment. We classify the literature by areas considering three main subjects: resource evaluation, operation, and applications, and in each section we describe the possible directions to be taken in the research of the field. We find that the main applications are done for forecasting, fault diagnosis, maintenance, operation, planning, sizing and risk management.

SCOPUS_ID:84971500400,"Power loss minimization and voltage stability improvement are important areas of power systems due to existing transmission line contingency, financial loss of utility and power system blackouts. Optimal allocation (i.e. siting and sizing) of Distributed Generation (DG) is one of the best ways to strengthen the efficiency of power system among capacitor placement and network reconfiguration. Power system operators and researchers put forward their efforts to solve the distribution system problem related to power loss, energy loss, voltage profile, and voltage stability based on optimal DG allocation. Furthermore, optimal DG allocation secures distribution system from unwanted events and allows the operator to run the system in islanding mode. In this paper a comprehensive study is carried out for optimum DG placement considering minimization of power/energy losses, enhancement of voltage stability, and improvement of voltage profile. An attempt has been made to summarize the existing approaches and present a detailed discussion which can help the energy planners in deciding which objective and planning factors need more attention for optimum DG allocation for a given location or in a given scenario.",Sultana U.,2016-09-01,A review of optimum DG placement based on minimization of power losses and voltage stability enhancement of distribution system

This phenomenon also applies to Pattern Recognition so that classic and common algorithms, such as the k-Nearest Neighbour, are unable to be used. To improve the efficiency of this classifier, Prototype Selection (PS) strategies can be used. Nevertheless, current PS algorithms were not designed to deal with distributed data, and their performance is therefore unknown under these conditions. This work is devoted to carrying out an experimental study on a simulated framework in which PS strategies can be compared under classical conditions as well as those expected in distributed scenarios. Our results report a general behaviour that is degraded as conditions approach to more realistic scenarios. However, our experiments also show that some methods are able to achieve a fairly similar performance to that of the non-distributed scenario.

SCOPUS_ID:84969883888,"Electricity load forecasting is crucial for effective operation and management of buildings. Support Vector Regression (SVR) have been successfully used in solving nonlinear regression and time series problems related to building energy consumption forecasting. As the performance of SVR heavily depends on the selection of its parameters, differential evolution (DE) algorithm is employed in this study to solve this problem. The forecasting model is developed using weighted SVR models with nu-SVR and epsilon-SVR. The DE algorithm is again used to determine the weights corresponding to each model. A case of time series energy consumption data from an institutional building in Singapore is used to elucidate the performance of the proposed model. The proposed model can be used to forecast both, half-hourly and daily electricity consumption time series data for the same building. The results show that for half-hourly data, the model exhibits higher weight for nu-SVR, whereas for daily data, a higher weight for epsilon-SVR is observed. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for daily energy consumption data is 5.843 and that for half-hourly energy consumption is 3.767 respectively. A detailed comparison with other evolutionary algorithms show that the proposed model yields higher accuracy for building energy consumption forecasting.",Zhang F.,2016-08-15,Time series forecasting for building energy consumption using weighted Support Vector Regression with differential evolution optimization technique
SCOPUS_ID:84963548318,"This study attempts to model the spatio-temporal dynamics of total phosphate (TP) concentrations along a river for effective hydro-environmental management. We propose a systematical modeling scheme (SMS), which is an ingenious modeling process equipped with a dynamic neural network and three refined statistical methods, for reliably predicting the TP concentrations along a river simultaneously. Two different types of artificial neural network (BPNN—static neural network; NARX network—dynamic neural network) are constructed in modeling the dynamic system. The Dahan River in Taiwan is used as a study case, where ten-year seasonal water quality data collected at seven monitoring stations along the river are used for model training and validation. Results demonstrate that the NARX network can suitably capture the important dynamic features and remarkably outperforms the BPNN model, and the SMS can effectively identify key input factors, suitably overcome data scarcity, significantly increase model reliability, satisfactorily estimate site-specific TP concentration at seven monitoring stations simultaneously, and adequately reconstruct seasonal TP data into a monthly scale.

SCOPUS_ID:84963628979,"Forecasting of the solar irradiance is a key feature in order to increase the penetration rate of solar energy into the energy grids. Indeed, the anticipation of the fluctuations of the solar renewables allows a better management of the production means of electricity and a better operation of the grid-connected storage systems. If numerous methods for forecasting the mean of the solar irradiance were recently developed, there are only few works dedicated to the evaluation of prediction intervals associated to these point forecasts.
                  Time series of solar irradiance and more specifically of clear sky index show some similarities with that of financial time series. The aim of this paper is to assess the performances of a commonly used combination of two linear models (ARMA and GARCH) in econometrics in order to provide probabilistic forecasts of solar irradiance. In addition, a recursive estimation of the parameters of the models has been set up in order to provide a framework that can be applied easily in an operational context.
                  A comprehensive testing procedure has been used to assess both point forecasts and probabilistic forecasts. Using only the past records of the solar irradiance, the proposed model is able to perform point forecasts as accurately as other methods based on machine learning techniques. Moreover, the recursive ARMA–GARCH model is easier to set-up and it gives additional information about the uncertainty of the forecasts. Even if some strong assumption has been made regarding the statistical distribution of the error, the reliability of the probabilistic forecasts stands in the same order of magnitude as other works done in the field of solar forecasting.",David M.,2016-08-01,Probabilistic forecasting of the solar irradiance with recursive ARMA and GARCH models

This methodology includes the use of specific data sources, specific features of calendar days defined using these data sources, and the application of a specific form of classification and then cluster analysis. The application of this methodology will produce results that enable historical analysis of the use of initiatives and evaluation of the relative success of different courses of action. Several challenges are overcome here including the need to identify the appropriate machine learning algorithms to apply, to quantify the differences between calendar days, to select features describing days, to obtain appropriate raw data, and to evaluate results in a meaningful way. These challenges are overcome via a review of relevant literature, the identification and trial of several useful models and data sets, and careful application of methods. For example, the cluster analysis that ultimately selects sets of similar days uses a distance metric based on variable importance measures from a separate classification model of observed initiatives. The methodology defined here is applied to the New York area, although it could be applied by other researchers to other areas.",Kuhn K.D.,2016-08-01,A methodology for identifying similar days in air traffic flow management initiative planning
SCOPUS_ID:84964345705,"The purpose of the short-term electricity demand forecasting is to forecast in advance the system load, represented by the sum of all consumers load at the same time. Power load forecasting is important for an economically efficient operation and effective control of power systems and enables to plan the load of generating units. A precise load forecasting is required to avoid high generation costs and the spinning reserve capacity. Under-prediction of the demands leads to an insufficient reserve capacity preparation and can threaten the system stability, on the other hand, over-prediction leads to an unnecessarily large reserve that leads to high cost preparations. Differential polynomial neural network is a new neural network type, which decomposes and solves the selective general partial differential equation, which can model a searched function on the bases of observed data samples. It produces an output sum combination of convergent series of selected relative polynomial derivative terms, which can substitute for an ordinary differential equation solution to describe and forecast real data time-series. Partial derivative terms of several time-point variables substitute for the time derivatives of the converted general ordinary differential equation. The operating principles of the proposed method differ significantly from other conventional neural network techniques.",Zjavka L.,2016-08-01,Short-term power load forecasting with ordinary differential equation substitutions of polynomial networks

We present a new method based on advanced machine learning algorithms for variable selection and prediction. The correlation based variable selection identifies a small set of informative variables that are used as inputs for an ensemble of neural networks and support vector regression algorithms to generate the predictions. We develop two types of models: univariate, that use only previous PV power data, and multivariate, that also use previous weather data, and evaluate their performance on Australian PV data for two years. The results show that the univariate models performed similarly to the multivariate models, achieving mean relative error of 4.15–9.34%. Hence, the PV power output for very short-term forecasting horizons of 5–60min can be predicted accurately by using only previous PV power data, without weather information. The most accurate model was univariate ensemble of neural networks, predicting the PV power output separately for each step of the forecasting horizon.",Rana M.,2016-08-01,Univariate and multivariate methods for very short-term solar photovoltaic power forecasting
SCOPUS_ID:84974714507,"High demand for photovoltaic (PV), battery, and small-scale combined heat and power (CHP) technologies are driving a virtuous cycle of technological improvements and cost reductions in off-grid electric systems that increasingly compete with the grid market. Using a case study in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, this paper quantifies the economic viability of off-grid PV+battery+CHP adoption and evaluates potential implications for grid-based utility models. The analysis shows that already some households could save money by switching to a solar hybrid off-grid system in comparison to the effective electric rates they are currently paying. Across the region by 2020, 92% of seasonal households and ~75% of year-round households are projected to meet electricity demands with lower costs. Furthermore, ~65% of all Upper Peninsula single-family owner-occupied households will both meet grid parity and be able to afford the systems by 2020. The results imply that economic circumstances could spur a positive feedback loop whereby grid electricity prices continue to rise and increasing numbers of customers choose alternatives (sometimes referred to as a “utility death spiral”), particularly in areas with relatively high electric utility rates.

We then generate predictions of survey indicators, which are usually used as explanatory variables in econometric models. We compare the forecasting performance of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to that of three different time series models. By combining both types of analysis, we find that ANN models outperform time series models in countries in which the evolution of expectations shows brisk changes before impending shocks.

Thanks to data mining and artificial intelligence techniques that allow the accurate forecasting of power, which alleviates many of the cost and operational challenges because, power predictions become more certain. Load forecasting (LF) is a vital process for the electrical system operation and planning as it provides intelligence to energy management. In this paper, a novel LF strategy is proposed by employing data mining techniques. In addition to a novel load estimation, the proposed LF strategy employs new outlier rejection and feature selection methodologies. Outliers are rejected through a Distance Based Outlier Rejection (DBOR) methodology. On the other hand, selecting the effective features is accomplished through a Hybrid technique that combines evidence from two proposed feature selectors. The first is a Genetic Based Feature Selector (GBFS), while the second is a Rough set Base Feature Selector (RBFS). Then, the filtered data is used to give fast and accurate load prediction through a hybrid KN3B predictor, which combines KNN and NB classifiers. Experimental results have proven the effectiveness of the new outlier rejection, feature selection, and load estimation methodologies. Moreover, the proposed LF strategy has been compared against recent LF strategies.

Space programs will be more cost-effective when they work to establish a supply chain in space, mining and manufacturing then replicating the assets of the supply chain so it grows to larger capacity. This has become achievable because of advances in robotics and artificial intelligence. It is roughly estimated that developing a lunar outpost that relies upon and also develops the supply chain will cost about 1/3 or less of the existing annual budgets of the national space programs. It will require a sustained commitment of several decades to complete, during which time science and exploration become increasingly effective. At the end, this space industry will capable of addressing global-scale challenges including limited resources, clean energy, economic development, and preservation of the environment. Other potential solutions, including nuclear fusion and terrestrial renewable energy sources, do not address the root problem of our limited globe and there are real questions whether they will be inadequate or too late. While industry in space likewise cannot provide perfect assurance, it is uniquely able to solve the root problem, and it gives us an important chance that we should grasp. What makes this such an historic opportunity is that the space-based solution is obtainable as a side-benefit of doing space science and exploration within their existing budgets. Thinking pragmatically, it may take some time for policymakers to agree that setting up a complete supply chain is an achievable goal, so this paper describes a strategy of incremental progress.

Only 13 Member States have implemented graphic labels that differ in their design, metrics, and classification of vehicles. The fuel consumption data displayed to consumers underrate yearly fuel costs in the order of several hundred Euros per car. We argue that car labelling can be made more effective if Member States adopt: (i) a uniform label that mirrors, as far as feasible, the design of the EU energy label, (ii) data and classification metrics that accurately reflect the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions observed by consumers, and (iii) a labelling scale that allows differentiation between efficient hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles.

The paper introduces particle filter to precisely match the feature points within a desired region predicted by a kinetic equation, and presents a least square estimation-based algorithm to measure the relative rolling motion of non-cooperative spacecraft. The state transition equation and the measurement update equation of non-cooperative spacecraft are represented by establishing its kinetic equations, and then the relative pose measurement is converted to the maximum posterioriprobability estimation via assuming the uncertainties about geometric structure and motion pattern as random and time-varying variables. These uncertainties would be interpreted and even solved through continuously measuring the image feature points of the rotating non-cooperative infrared spacecraft. Subsequently, the feature point is matched within a predicted region among sequence infrared image using particle filter algorithm to overcome the position estimation noise caused by the uncertainties of geometric structure and motion pattern. Finally, the position parameters including rotation motion are estimated by means of solving the minimum error of feature point mismatching using least square estimate theory. Both simulated and real infrared image sequences are induced in the experiment to evaluate the performance of the relative rolling estimation, and the experimental data show that the rolling motion estimated by the proposed algorithm is more robust to the feature extraction noise and various rotation speed.

Improvements of the prediction models with more accurate results and lower error are necessary for future development of the microgrids projects and of the economic dispatch sector. The LS-SVM (Least Square Support Vector Machine), a relatively unexplored neural network known as GMDH (Group Method of Data Handling) and a novel hybrid algorithm GLSSVM (Group Least Square Support Vector Machine), based on the combination of the first two models, were implemented to forecast the PV (Photovoltaic) output power at several time horizons up to 24 h. In order to improve the forecasting accuracy, each model was combined with three strategies for multi-step ahead forecast (Direct, Recursive and DirRec). A detail analysis of the normalized mean error is carried out to compare the different forecasting methods, using the historical PV output power data of a 960 kWP grid connected PV system in the south of Italy. The outcomes demonstrate the GLSSVM method with the DirRec strategy can give a normalized error of 2.92% under different weather conditions with evident improvements respect to the traditional ANN (Artificial Neural Network).",De Giorgi M.G.,2016-07-15,Comparison of strategies for multi-step ahead photovoltaic power forecasting models based on hybrid group method of data handling networks and least square support vector machine
SCOPUS_ID:84964617606,"This work develops guidance and tools to understand the performance, improve the design, and simplify the evaluation of naturally ventilated low-rise commercial buildings in warm and hot climates. We conducted ∼50,000 detailed energy and airflow simulations in 427 locations across Brazil, varying 55 parameters representing building morphology, fenestration, construction properties, internal gains, operating times, wind modifiers, flowpaths, window control, and soil traits. Comfort performance was quantified by the average annual fraction of occupied hours that exceeded the upper limit of an adaptive comfort zone, and investigated with sensitivity analysis and machine learning methods. Results indicated that, after climate, building size (both footprint area and number of stories) and internal gains were most influential and were positively associated with discomfort. Adding air movement with ceiling fans and providing for night ventilation both proved highly effective comfort interventions. Except for roof solar absorptance, opaque envelope changes, including increasing insulation or thermal mass, had only marginal impacts. A support vector regression metamodel, requiring 29 easily obtainable inputs plus a weather file, was fit to the simulation results and successfully validated (R

                     =0.97). The metamodel was developed as a simplified compliance path for naturally ventilated buildings to enhance Brazil’s commercial building performance labeling program, which, because it currently provides such a path only for air conditioned buildings, may discouraging decision-makers from considering even more efficient passive solutions. We use a case study to show how the metamodel, which we will distribute publicly, can also serve as a design tool, and demonstrate that modifying a small set of parameters can drastically improve thermal performance and achieve sustainable comfort in hot and warm climates.",Rackes A.,2016-07-15,Naturally comfortable and sustainable: Informed design guidance and performance labeling for passive commercial buildings in hot climates

                     . The initial time series is first decomposed by means of the aforementioned nonstationary modelling into a seasonal mean value and a residual time series multiplied by a seasonal standard deviation. Then, the FIS/ANFIS models are applied to the stationary part only in order to calculate forecasts of future values. Using the nonstationary modelling, forecasts of the full time series are finally obtained. For comparison purposes, the FIS/ANFIS models are also applied to the initial nonstationary series. The performance of both forecasting procedures is assessed by means of well-known error measures. The methodology is applied to obtain (a) point-wise forecasts for a specific datapoint and (b) field-wise forecasts for the whole field of wave parameters. Especially, the latter is performed for the first time. The comparison of the error measures from the two approaches showed that the forecasts based on the proposed methodology outperform the ones using only FIS/ANFIS models.",Stefanakos C.,2016-07-15,Fuzzy time series forecasting of nonstationary wind and wave data

SCOPUS_ID:84963804051,"We model the smart grid as a decentralized and hierarchical network, made up of three categories of agents: suppliers, generators and captive consumers organized in microgrids. To optimize their decisions concerning prices and traded power, agents need to forecast the demand of the microgrids and the fluctuating renewable productions. The biases resulting from the decentralized learning could create imbalances between demand and supply leading to penalties for suppliers and for generators. We analytically determine prices that provide generators with a guarantee to avoid such penalties, transferring risk to the suppliers. Additionally, we prove that collaborative learning, through coalitions of suppliers among which information is shared, minimizes the sum of their average risk. Simulations run for a large sample of parameter combinations, using external and internal regret minimization, show that the convergence of collaborative learning strategies is clearly faster than that resulting from individual learning. Finally, we analyze the suppliers’ incentives to organize in a grand coalition versus multiple coalitions, and the tightness of the learning algorithm’s theoretical bounds.",Le Cadre H.,2016-07-05,Dealing with uncertainty in the smart grid: A learning game approach

SCOPUS_ID:84964378080,"Hash-routing is a well-known technique used in server-cluster environments to direct content requests to the responsible servers hosting the requested content. In this work, we look at hash-routing from a different angle and apply the technique to Information-Centric Networking (ICN) environments, where in-network content caches serve as temporary storage for content. In particular, edge-domain routers re-direct requests to in-network caches, more often than not off the shortest path, according to the hash-assignment function. Although the benefits of this off-path in-network caching scheme are significant (e.g., high cache hit rate with minimal co-ordination overhead), the basic scheme comes with disadvantages. That is, in case of very large domains the off-path detour of requests might increase latency to prohibitive levels. In order to deal with extensive detour delays, we investigate nodal/domain clustering techniques, according to which large domains are split in clusters, which in turn apply hash-routing in the subset of nodes of each cluster. We model and evaluate the behaviour of nodal clustering and report significant improvement in delivery latency, which comes at the cost of a slight decrease in cache hit rates (i.e., up to 50% improvement in delivery latency for less than 10% decrease in cache hit rate compared to the original hash-routing scheme applied in the whole domain).",Sourlas V.,2016-07-05,Efficient Hash-routing and Domain Clustering Techniques for Information-Centric Networks

SCOPUS_ID:84964350663,"Accurate weather information is required to assess the performance of sustainable buildings. Currently such performance is assessed using Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) weather files. TMY3 is the latest TMY file introduced by Department of Energy (DOE) and it represents the historical 30-year average of weather data more closely than any other available datasets. However, TMY3 data reflects the past and do not accurately forecast weather information thus leading to erroneous estimation of performance and economic feasibility. Therefore, more accurate methods are necessary to generate weather files so as to design buildings for sustainability and resilience. This article proposes an effective hybrid modeling methodology based on support vector machine regression and probability estimation to predict long term future weather variables. The methodology has been validated by using a dataset containing historical solar irradiance data for 54 years (1961–2014) for Cincinnati, Ohio. By implementing the proposed technique multiple models were trained with different segments of the dataset, which were used to predict the hourly solar irradiance for 8, 9, 10 and 11 years respectively. Subsequently, the predicted data and the current TMY3 data was compared with the actual historical data. The average increase in accuracy of the predicted over TMY3 direct normal and diffuse horizontal components of solar irradiance was found to be 38.43% and 11.8%. These findings suggest that the long term accuracy of the proposed modeling technique is greater than the current state-of-the-art.",Chakraborty D.,2016-07-01,Generation of accurate weather files using a hybrid machine learning methodology for design and analysis of sustainable and resilient buildings

SCOPUS_ID:84961115864,"The progressive application of Information and Communication Technologies to industrial processes has increased the amount of data gathered by manufacturing companies during last decades. Nowadays some standardized management systems, such as ISO 50.001 and ISO 14.001, exploit these data in order to minimize the environmental impact of manufacturing processes. At the same time, microgrid architectures are progressively being developed, proving to be suitable for supplying energy to continuous and intensive consumptions, such as manufacturing processes.
                  In the merge of these two tendencies, industrial microgrid development could be considered a step forward towards more sustainable manufacturing processes if planning engineers are capable to design a power supply system, not only focused on historical demand data, but also on manufacturing and environmental data. The challenge is to develop a more sustainable and proactive microgrid which allows identifying, designing and developing energy efficiency strategies at supply, management and energy use levels.
                  In this context, the expansion of Internet of things and Knowledge Discovery in Databases techniques will drive changes in current microgrid planning processes. In this paper, technical literature is reviewed and this innovative approach to microgrid planning is introduced.",Gamarra C.,2016-07-01,A knowledge discovery in databases approach for industrial microgrid planning
